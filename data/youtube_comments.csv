"When you say assigned seating, what does that mean? You‚Äôll put me in a middle seat I never pick a middle seat."
"SWA has major problems with fake preborders and seat savers. Open seating means those who board FIRST get the best seats. Open seating incentivizes lying. Go to any SWA gate and notice the # of wheelchairs compared to the other airlines. The boarding order is crucial on SWA and many pay extra to board early only to hear other brag about &quot;getting on early for free,&quot; as we walk down the aisle. Once assigned seats start, the only incentive to preboard will be bin space."
Some passengers will not adhere to the assigned seating. There are already issues with other airlines that already offer assigned seating only to have another passenger take their seat. Flight attendants either are going to ignore it (not my problem) or offer the passenger whose assigned seat was taken another less desirable seat. <br><br>Article: ‚Äú Plane Passenger Says Fellow Traveler Stole Her Seat Then Gave Her a ‚ÄòBlank‚Äô Stare When Presented with Proof‚Äù
"I don&#39;t really care about Southwest decision to make  their seating open-seating assigned seating. I do prefer open-seating policy. The Assinged seats is not always a guarntee due to overbooked or weight mass on the plane to keep it in balance to avoid any potential accidents in the plane during take off , landing , taxing , and flying.  I have flied with Delta and not I saying it is bad airline. I will still fly with most likely Southwest or Delta over any other airlines but I am not gone question anyone else opinion. I will not recommmended for buying a private planes or jets for a quick walk downtown. We all are human heres unless if they are aliens roaming by us."
"If you buy the basic fare (want to get away) you will not know what your seat is until 24 hours before. You don&#39;t get to pick your seat during the purchase. It could be a middle seat or a seat you don&#39;t like, and you can&#39;t change it. It will not be with family or friends either. For all the people that complain about no assign seating this is way worse. Good job clowns."
We have to pay more wow exciting and more money to buy more peanuts
I&#39;m all for it. This will hopefully end the &quot;miracle of flight&quot; bs that goes on now.
Existing Southwest customers  overwhelmingly love the current open seating. New customers are just clueless and didn&#39;t take a moment to understand that you could buy ahead of the line status if you really needed to seat a group together.
I preferred open seating
Lining up for open seating felt like lining up the cattle to get onto a cattle truck destined for the slaughter house.  It just screamed cheap airline so im glad its gone; absolutely hated it. As far as the push and likely inevitably of the impending demise of &quot;bags fly free&quot; well that will be the end of my flying Southwest because at that point they&#39;re just another low fare cheap feeling &quot;have your credit card ready&quot; nickel and dime airline joining the likes of Spirit and Frontier to name a couple. Southwest is not the lowest fare in town but as a passenger you accept this knowing you wont be put over a barrel to the tune of $150 a trip to have a checked bag so if that goes away then you just have another no frills airline..... nothing special at that point to justify paying the higher fare.
"Southwest wanting to go bankrupt. Bye! The ONLY reason I ever flew SW was the open seating. Stupidest Decision Ever, there is literally nothing better about SW than any other airline."
"SWA will get through this transition, and so will I... It&#39;ll very likely remain one of my regular airlines for travel due to their network."
"Take away 7 inches, give you 3. You are still a sucker."
Looks way better. I hated the open seating.
As a person in a wheelchair. Being able to book seats makes travel so much easier.
Delta has first class.
I‚Äôd like to know where they got the 80% from- I‚Äôm a frequent flyer and I was never asked or polled. I don‚Äôt want assigned seats- if so might as well go to other airlines!!!!!
The new change makes me very sad. Open seating was one of my biggest reasons for flying southwest.
"No one should have to pay extra to sit comfortably in these chairs so they add a few more inches of what we should already have for free and then they want to charge you for sitting comfortably, which is complete BS and this is something that department of transportation, addresses and enforces and makes it to where are you don‚Äôt have to pay extra to sit comfortably in your chair"
"So they didn‚Äôt mention anything about disabled people like my mom who has mental and cancer in every part of her body and she hast to sit in the front I mean, if it‚Äôs a sign seating, how is she going to sit towards the front or daughter has a serious condition where she Hass to be near the bathroom in the French it happens if you can‚Äôt get it? I need to explain this better."
"Love the outlets, more leg space, and the assigned seats will hopefully help boarding the flight go more smoothly."
"all seats need to be premium. government should enforce that everyone gets enough leg room. If it is for overseas, then more leg room. we&#39;re in 21st century and still no improvement in quality of seating."
"Back in 1997, after spending a week with my ADHD mother, I climbed on a Southwest plane, laid across three seats, cinched up a seat belt and I was asleep before the plane took off. I guess I could not do that today."
How is this news? This is advertising at best.
Make the people with fat rolls that spill over the arm rest pay for a whole row. Then your customers will be happy
Good! I hate their dumb ass cattle call seating. I feel like everybody is mooing on their way to the plane...mooooooo! MOOOOOOOOO!
Good. I‚Äôm tired of being bullied by fat black couples in their late 50‚Äôs.
"Well true bad, party over."
This was literally the only reason to fly with Southwest. The service is üí© the cancelations are üí© and the seats aren&#39;t even that great where we should have to pay for them. I guess it time to fly with another company since they are going to be the worst.
"I personally preferred the open seating because my family will also want seats on row 17 or after usually.  I have no perfence to the assigned policy. My dad doesn&#39;t really like that they are change in to assigned seat because in the pandemic for Covid-19 which other airlines will charged extra to sit as a family to sit together and also not have freedom to find &quot; the good seat&quot; . <br><br>There is maybe a solution and a fair comprise. One not limited a guesting for those who reserved a seat to guaranteed seats for those overweight and  tall people. Then , there will be passenger who preferred the open-seating policy. The how will the boarding process will be  pre-board passenger , reserved passenger , normal boarding , family boarding , group from ( A1 to 15 , A16 to 30,  C1 to C30). The reserved passenger those people who wants to check in the last mins can reserved. This may cost money or not .  This idea is gone work because it meet the needs of all 100% of passenger and the potetional customers . Does anyone liked my idea ?<br><br>The idea of assignee seats reminded about the classroom assigned seat when I was in school which I don&#39;t like.  My  school bus had open-seating policy but they can&#39;t use Seat 2 because my friend and I have some extra needs. I have an disablity and my friend is not allowed to sit in the back because she had tendency of causing trouble or sleeping which will mostly like let her missed the stop. The school when their was elementary on the bus and they want the front rows to be for elementary students to not loose tracked of them."
So because of some whiny investors they are starting to change what has worked for 60 years. The more the become like the other airlines they Will lose customers
"Yay, so now I&#39;m going to have to pay for my seats! Said nobody ever. Who on earth wouldn&#39;t like the open seating system?"
This is one of the best decision South worst airlines to go to assigned seats. Really helpful when flying with family
If they dont keep the 2 checked bags then there is no reason to fly sluthwest unless yoy dont have the option not to.<br>Theyve already gone up in cost and are up there with delta and united. Youre gonna gave to pay for seats now like every other airline.<br>Two checked bags is all they ha e left
"Go fly another airline. Like bro United, american delta, every other american airline has assigned seating and the same exact aircraft, The 737-700 to Max is used everywhere"
"If you pay for the &#39;Early Bird&#39; option you are relatively guaranteed a good seat. You can bet that the premium leg room seats will be  much more expensive than the &#39;Early Bird&#39; option. It&#39;s a slippery road down to the level of the United and American cattle car flights. I can also imagine that in order to accommodate those extra leg room seats in one third of the cabin, the over-all cabin legroom will be reduced. Southwest now has the best legroom of any economy seating, look for that to disappear as well."
boooo. I like open seats and free bags. so they don&#39;t care about their loyal customers.
"THE ONLY folks B &amp; M‚Äôing about wanting assigned seats (&amp; 1st class seats) are elitist business class people. To ALL of you snobby, cry baby traditional Business Class flyers&#39; take your behinds to another airline. BUT even more egregious is SWA saying &quot;their customer base&quot; wanted this. I call BS! SWA was LOOKING for another way to MAKE money &amp; they found a convenient lie &amp; group of people that were willing to take the fall. SWA has been going downhill in their customer service with their nasty flight attendants &amp; rude gate folks for years. Good riddance to slowly spoiling SWA greedy executives &amp; never-enough stock holders."
I like aisle seats üí∫ cause I‚Äôm claustrophobic and I pee a lot
They are going to charge extra for seats
Next up: ‚ÄúWe surveyed our customers and 90% of them say they would prefer to be charged for checked bags‚Äù üòÇ
Not to mention they are &quot;upgrading&quot; the interior to include the oh so comfortable 90 degree plastic seats with essentially 0 cushion!
The window seats will cost you.
Now go back to hiring on merit alone.
Thank God.  I am tired of getting bumped when I follow the rules.  It should work out much better or at least I hope.
"This is so stupid, unassigned seating was the best"
Yuck. I&#39;d never fly with those loser passengers anyway. Have fun!
I‚Äôm sure you will have to pay for seats and next will come baggage fees.
Say goodbye üëãüèæ to wanna get away flights
That new airport name still makes me cringe
"I never understood why you&#39;d want to pay more for slightly more legroom on a short flight, even up to 5 hours. It makes sense only for trans-Atlantic/Pacific flights. Assigned seats are not an advantage for me. Free bags are."
About time they have joined an orderly society.
"Lol, think it will work? lol"
Seated is kinder to seniors &amp; disabled.
"Please stop, it is the Oakland Airport."
It&#39;s probably a good thing. I&#39;ve always avoided flying Southwest cuz it&#39;s like being on a bus.
I wish southwest would have passengers that are not taking luggage to pit in the overhead board first. Biggest hold ups when getting off the plane is waiting for people to get luggage out of bins
Well this sucks. Fly another airline if you want assigned seats. Those people sound like they have some personal problems with who does and doesn‚Äôt sit next to them.
It‚Äôs about time they did this. The movie theaters figured this out years ago! üòÇ
"I had no idea of Southwest was so wild west when it comes to seating.<br><br>Then again, I&#39;ve never flown on Southwest. And ever since their system crash last year, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m ever going to."
No not true. Keep open seating.
"I have witnessed brawls over seats. I have seen children separated from parents, and married couples separated by selfish, nasty passengers. It is one of the things I hate about that airline. For them to say we preferred the open seating is just a lie. I have never known anyone who liked that. They were just being cheap. No assigned seats means far less work, and far less to keep track of‚Äîwhich requires more people, more training, and more technology. In another word: money. They were just being cheap. This particular change is probably more about tracking unruly passengers better, and of course: crashes. When the seats are unassigned, it is far more difficult to identify passengers. Security, and the legal department are behind the seating change, I am certain. No American corporation suddenly volunteers to spend millions more a year."
"I kind of liked the no assigned seat policy.  I usually boarded towards the end, but I always managed to find a decent seat.  It was easy to choose rows that had smaller people in them so that I wasn&#39;t squished in."
"These changes seem like a good idea.  Assigned seating (and the option of more leg room) will accommodate flyers wanting more space.  I particularly like the addition of red-eye flights.  I hope the new and yet defined boarding strategy will be to board rear seats first and restrict flyers to the overhead bins in their section of the plane.  Additionally, I hope they amend their policy for oversized flyers.  If a person needs 2 seats, they should pay for 2 seats.  The notion that anyone gets a free seat (denying that seat to someone else) is unfair.  As someone that fits in a single seat, I object to subsidizing anyone else&#39;s fare."
Goddam it
Great Biden Administration achievement!!<br>- Pro-regulation<br>- Pro-HIGH TAX<br>üòä
love this option.... tired of sitting next to slobs and stinky people that cram in the middle row in the C group and you paid to be in the A group. These nasty people finally feed up the others and now they will pay or sit in the back where they should sit!!
"The Airline&#39; seat assignment is yet another way to nickel and dime you. For those who remember, picking your seat used to be free. Then airlines started to charge for the seats with more legroom. Typically, those at the exits. Today, you have to pay for any seat you elect. Even if it is a middle seat. <br>Since you can&#39;t fly standing, I no longer pick a seat, and I get it assigned at the airport. My last flight with United, my seat was assigned at the gate, and of course a middle seat. But it was free of charge. Then Airlines complain about the passenger&#39;s behavior. <br>I really enjoyed Southwest way, because it made boarding so easy compared to other airlines. I understand they want to increase their revenue."
"Now southwest wants to charge for assigned seating, southwest losing its uniqueness. next up, paid baggage.."
That&#39;s bullcrap. We should be able to sit where we want.
We are happy!! Thank you SWA. No more liars or tiktoks explaining how to fake preboard.
I am happy for asssign seating.
lol.  corporate not happy with their profits... as if profit growth for infinity is even possible.
Damn southwest  üò† üò°
As long as checked bags are still free we good
I hate flying SWA<br>It seems like I end up sharing my seat with that passenger who should have a bigger seat or need to buy two seats.
But wait!  They did not mention they are adding leg room at the expense of the last rows that they are taking away leg room!
I will gladly face you one on one to determine who is better woke bastards
Fuck you woke people
"All the fat asses think they can make a difference, fuck them"
Airlines are private companies and it‚Äôs not a constitutional right to fly
I just want two numbers ‚Äî- new vs old leg room and new vs old seat room!!!
"Because of where I go, I fly only SouthWest. Forget the seats, legroom, bid space, etc. Stop making the cabins FLEEZING COLD!!!!! I recently flew 4 flights on SW, and even the men were complaining how cold the cabin was. I almost delayed a take off because I was out of my seat taking cloths out of my carryon to layer on top of my cloths. I literally put on a second set of clothing. On another flight, I was screaming at a flight attendant, &quot;You have eyes, don&#39;t you? You see all the passengers bundled up. You can see we are all freezing. What is wrong with you?&quot; They did warm up the cabin after that. On another flight, the attendants asked passengers to close the window blinds so the cabin did not heat up while we were on the tarmac, I refused. And, yes the 1st thing I do on a plane is wipe down my area with alcohol wipes and then I shut down all the blowers even for the seats next to mine."
"If I‚Äôm not comfortable when flying,I don‚Äôt fly them again. When company‚Äôs prove to you they don‚Äôt care about your comfort don‚Äôt give them your money. It‚Äôs our only weapon against these corporate theives"
Schumm Light
I like the seats
"For God&#39;s sake, what difference do seats make?"
Skiles Turnpike
These seats suck
Big dinner tray for a bag of pretzels
They‚Äôre full of shit.leg room and seat width is what people care about but of course that would impact the number of seats on board which is why they don‚Äôt change it. Honestly they think people are stupid.

"There‚Äôs no controversy. If you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt fly. Airlines owe you nothing"
I&#39;m for Ejection seats for unruly passengers!
The legroom looks somewhat ok <br><br>BUT the be seats themselves look UNGODLY UNCOMFORTABLE
SWA is a joke nowadays
Whoa-- those aisles tho..looks like you&#39;d have to shimmy sideways..
You accept less for more. Thats your fault.
Definitely ozempic seats
"Airlines could give a crap about passenger comfort.. Treat people like lab rats , the seats are so thin and uncomfortable..."
Wooow I can charge my phone while developing back problems ü•π they really shouldn‚Äôt have..
No bag fee
"Next to US Railroads, there is no more horribly-managed business segment than the airline industry. It‚Äôs a joke. And all of that being treated like animals crap would stop if we‚Äôd stand up and stop buying tickets. We‚Äôre just too insecure to take a stand. Mooooooo!"
"I‚Äôve ridden them, legroom is abyssmal, which is why you can‚Äôt recline them and your head rolls around like a bobblehead if you fall asleep. Thumbs down!"
"I vote for forcing the Airline CEO&#39;s &amp; planners to ONLY be allowed to have passenger seats in their offices, all day long!"
This is why people fight in airplanes. Uncomfortable seats üí∫ and people seating too close to each other. <br>This is why boomers had the best years but they say we new generation have it easy because we have Netflix
"I can deal with the new seat cushions, headrests, power outlets, but don&#39;t allow people talking on cellphones and screaming babies the entire trip. It is more than annoying to listen to a loud, 1-way cellphone conversation or uncontrollable, screaming kid on a flight."
"Seems to be a misunderstanding about the power outlets. As far as I know Southwest will ONLY upgrade their MAX-8 fleet with power outlets, and even that is moving slow."
I am 5‚Äô1‚Äù‚Ä¶ many times recently when I have been on a plane i have had less than an inch or maybe 2‚Äù between my knees and the back of the seat in front of me. Seems that an average height person would not find this very comfortable.
ONE INCH of seat bottom padding = misery even on a 1 hour flight!
Oh Please ‚Ä¶ the seats üí∫ clearly are thinner and less comfortable
I can&#39;t stand george.
"SW is NOT a budget airline! It‚Äôs just as expensive as DAL, AA and UA!!"
"Why do Americans INSIST on butchering international airline names? &quot;British Airways&quot; becomes &quot;british air&quot; or Swiss becomes &quot;Swiss air&quot; or Emirates Airline becomes &quot;Emirates AIR&quot;. I know it sounds like nitpicking, but them doing this consistently makes me wonder."
"Traveling on Delta used to be amazing, delays of 12hr plus and flight cancellations and bumps are what‚Äôs in store for high prices, frustrated crew and no one doing anything about it, while we are at the mercy of high prices for a bus in the air. I‚Äôll drive when I can from now on. It stinks that flights are completely booked even on red eyes. Cross country flight delays are a nightmare, and pricing of food and bev astronomical. It was cheaper to pay $100 for my additional guests in the sky lounge over paying and staying in terminalüò¢"
Social media simply sucks
"It is disgraceful that airline have seats with so little leg room that it is becoming concerning. On a long haul flight 14 hours in a cramped space I personally think it has an impact on your health. I am only 5 &#39; 3&quot; and I can stand the lack of leg space , no idea how a 6 footer does long haul flights. Just a case of disgusting greed by airlines."
"Sorry, those seats üí∫  will wear out fast.. they look like plastic chairs.. <br>Saw seats similar to those on another airline, and I was glad the flight was short.. anything longer than an hour would give me bruises üôÉ"
Those are Ryan air seats!!!
I don&#39;t get the criticism; it&#39;s been like this in Europe for decades with budget airlines ‚Äî you get what you pay for
"Looks very small, not travel friendly for tall or wider people. Also just in general looks uncomfortable! Not that I would be flying anyway...I rather drive and enjoy seeing the sites."
"This is how tv reporting works now, screenshots of Tik Tok comments?? üôÑüôÑüôÑ"
"There was more leg room in the 80&#39;s. I&#39;m short and leg room is tight, I feel sorry for those who are taller. Doesn&#39;t seem safe to fly with your legs up to your chin in seats that look very uncomfortable."
"I don‚Äôt fly much (really at all) they look fine to me. Better than the seats in public transit. Of course flying these days IS PUBLIC transit. <br><br>Gone are the days that airlines had to force people to choose air travel. <br><br>People forget Oil is expensive and that‚Äôs  why planes get overbook so those planes don‚Äôt fly empty. <br>Every seat üí∫ is a missed opportunity and a hugh waste of resources.<br><br>I mean I don‚Äôt know why people bitch soo much. Probably because Americans are used to their expensive cars and don‚Äôt realize airplanes are essentially like rentals. Overpriced and you don‚Äôt keep it at the end of the day. It‚Äôs just an effective faster way to get form point a to point b. <br><br>There are other option if your not crunched for time but everyone wants the fastest way to a Destination. <br><br>Trains are slower (and harder to find direct routes), cars are slower, ocean liners are almost dead since they have all switched to being cruise üö¢ ships since they couldn‚Äôt compete with airplanes in terms of speed. <br><br>So yeah airplanes ‚úàÔ∏è are really public transportation! So Get over it everyone!!!!"
