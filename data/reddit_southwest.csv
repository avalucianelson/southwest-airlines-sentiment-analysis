2024-09-23 22:40:14,Ranking the 18 Airlines I Have Flown,"Thought this would be a fun topic. In the last few years, I have flown with more and more airlines that were new to me. Now, there's about 18 to date that I can remember. 

I am based out of the east coast of the USA for reference. Main travel experience is domestic plus Mexico, Europe, and Asia. Fly economy every time. Going to include airlines that have since gone bankrupt. Surprisingly, I have never flown Delta or Southwest despite being big US carriers. With that in mind, here's my list: 

  
**18.** **XL Airways France-** easily the worst flight experience of my life. No entertainment options, tight seatings, no service whatsoever. Offered a cheap ticket to Paris. Airline went bankrupt one month after I flew with them, and I could definitely see why it happened. 



**17.** **Air Asia-** probably have taken about 10 flights with this airline just out of necessity. If you want to take a short flight route around Southeast Asia, you will likely have to go through this airline. Not a fan and I'd avoid them if they had more competition. Strictest airline I have seen about baggage weight with no thrills on top of it. 

  
**16. WOW Air-** another low budget airline that went bankrupt within two months of me flying them. Offered me an affordable way to get to Iceland. That's about the biggest pro. But a 7+ hour flight with no entertainment options and steep costs for checked bags were definitely cons. 

  
**15. American-** first US airline on the list. I primarily use this one for connecting flights to and from Mexico. I've had a few negative experiences while flying them plus the seats are pretty tight. Once I unexpectedly got told I had to check a carryon bag. And the only time I ever had a checked bag just not show up, it was on an American flight. Arrived a day late. Just more bad than good leads it to a low ranking. 

  
**14. Norwegian-** before Norse took over this route in the US, Norwegian had some cheap flights connecting through Oslo. Steep checked bag fees though and again, no entertainment for very long flights. Not quite as bad for comfort/service as others below though and I got from JFK to BKK through this airline so that's a win. 

  
**13. Hawaiian-** I'll admit, the service on this airline is pretty good and they are pretty laid back. But honestly, I think this airline is too expensive for what it is, which is just a quick 30-40 min flight to other Hawaiian islands. Plus, I personally think this airline has the ugliest interior of the bunch listed. 

  
**12. Scoot-** only took one short flight with this airline and honestly, I slept through most of it. Don't remember anything bad or great about it. Just a serviceable airline that felt like an improvement just coming from Air Asia. 

  
**11. JetBlue-** I haven't flown with this airline in over a decade. Hard to remember much about it. Like Scoot, nothing bad or great comes to mind. 

  
**10. Spirit-** it's the US airline people like to make fun of the most. I have never taken a flight longer than 6 hours with them but have used this airline for several domestic flights. It's great for light packers and they are not too strict about carry on bags. Also like that the flight attendants try to make flying with a budget airline fun and the little giveaways they do during flights. No entertainment makes longer flights tough but I like that they are creative with small tables to give more legroom. 

  
**9. United-** have BY FAR the most experience with this airline, so I have had my good and bad flights with this airline. However, I do think their international service is noticeably better than American. I don't like the fact this airline is aggressively nickeling and diming on domestic flights now though, and the domestic service is honestly kind of subpar overall. 

  
**8. SAS-** the most recent airline I flew with. Used this for four flights during my last trip. Pretty efficient and service/comfort on the flight was decent enough. However, their website is one of the most annoying to navigate, and not friendly for multi-city itineraries. Plus, I did not like the fact they charged for bags for a transatlantic flight. Overall, they could tighten up a little bit but the in-flight experience is pretty decent. 

  
**7. Volaris-** have used this a few times for domestic flights within Mexico. It's probably my favorite lower budget airline I have flown with to date. Really have had no hassle with them and the airplane seats are surprisingly comfortable given the product we are working with. Not as strict about bags compared to other lower budget airlines either. 



**6. Etihad-** harder to judge this airline because I took two flights with them in 2022. I did not like that they still had strong covid restrictions in the latter half of that year, such as wearing a mask the entire flight (which was at least 9 hours) when most places lifted that requirement by that point. This airline just seemed to have stricter policies overall, such as basically being the only one to ask to see my passport when I was on the plane looking for my seat. However, the service on the flight was great, seats were very comfortable, and checked bags were included to make up for the above. 

  
**5. Aer Lingus-** only took one flight with them but I had a pleasant experience. Seats were comfortable enough and wasn't too expensive. However, I think the service is really what puts them high on this list. Agent was very nice in finding me an aisle seat instead of my assigned middle seat when I checked in. Plus, a flight attendant basically snuck me a free beer I was suppose to pay for because I told her I had already been traveling for 20 hours straight before that flight (it was the last leg on the itinerary). 

  
**4. Philippine-** took one long haul with them. I might have gotten lucky with my seating, but this was one of the more pleasurable flights of 10+ hours I have ever taken. Very comfortable seats, checked bag included, and pretty good service. Their website would be my main point of criticism, not very user-friendly to navigate, especially when it comes to checking in for a flight. 

  
**3. EVA-** Getting to my elite airlines now. I used to rank this as my top airline. One amazing airline perk I got with them was a free shuttle ride to and from JFK whenever I had a flight ticket with them. And it used to be pretty affordable to get to Asia through them as well and they did a good job making it feel like a premium travel experience in economy. Unfortunately, price has gone up and the shuttle perk is gone. But I still have a great flight experience every time I use them. 

  
**2. Singapore-** this was easily the airline that managed pandemic flight conditions the best. Very organized and offered some extra hygiene products. Service was above and beyond and I flew during a time (end of 2021) where flights were still pretty empty. Seats were extremely comfortable too. 

  
**1. Emirates-** I used this airline to get to and from Asia in 2023. Total of six flights. Wow, was I blown away by what I got with this airline. The most comfortable economy seat I have ever had in my life, probably the biggest welcome package on board I ever received, and of course great service. It's the main airline I am actively trying to find again, I just haven't found the right flight itinerary to return to it yet and cost has gone up by me for it.

2022-08-16 14:57:13,Southwest Airline recent change to Early Bird proccess,"Have travelled extensively via Southwest Airlines and have been using the Early Bird boarding option, which until this summer has been great.  Had a recent flight and as usual I logged into to SW site get my boarding pass and get my Early Bird position locked.  SW site stated 'You have been automatically checked-in and lo and behold we had incredibly been given a B Group boarding position (27-28) even though I was doing this a few minutes after the 24 hour window to be able to check in.  We ended up sitting in the back 1/5 of the frigging plane.  Have been doing this quite awhile with SW and we've never gotten anything other than low to mid A group and always gotten seating in the first half of the plane..  

Come to find out by checking with SW, you no longer have the option to check yourself in (they do it at 36 hours pre-flight randomly assigning boarding group) and most importantly, you're basically screwed in getting a decent seat based on the luck of the draw, random system that they are using!  Essentially I spent an extra $80 ($160 round trip) for Early Bird to end up getting the same seating that I would have if I hadn't paid for Early Bird.  Pretty much a losing situation, for in the past the traveller who was on top of it and logged in close to the 24 hr flight window could almost always getting an A Group seating.

Screw you Southwest, I'll probably just roll back to back United who I used as my company carrier before I retired.  :(  :(",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/wpwgtq/southwest_airline_recent_change_to_early_bird/,"Southwest Airline recent change to Early Bird proccess Have travelled extensively via Southwest Airlines and have been using the Early Bird boarding option, which until this summer has been great.

2024-04-09 17:49:23,Airlines With Companion Pass?,"Hope this is the right place to ask this type of question.  I've searched quite a bit and I think the answer is ""no"", but wanted to confirm.

I have been a Southwest customer for years and fly 20-30 times a year.  My wife flies 10-20 times and has been my companion which saves us a ton on tickets.  I like Southwest, but the unassigned seats and larger and larger lines of preboarders is making it tough to keep flying with them.

I use the Southwest Business and Priority cards as well, so I get A-List and Companion Pass.  Still, with preboarders and lower requirements, A-list is getting to be less valuable.

Is there any other airline with companion pass?  I see that Delta has a companion certificate, but that's only for one flight per year.  Is there anything else at all like Southwest's companion pass for any other airlines that have assigned seating?

2017-04-10 19:41:12,Who gets booted first due to airline overbooking (in light of United Airlines incident),"Hey everyone, I'm not a regular to /r/travel, but I think I have a little research others might find valuable. In light of the [doctor being violently dragged off of a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/64jmub/doctor_violently_dragged_from_overbooked_united/) and the resulting social media backlash, I decided to do some digging into what airlines do when it comes to overbooking. All of the below information came from each individual airline's Contract of Carriage, which can be found on their websites (I've provided links to the ones I researched). Naturally I'm not going to have everyone's preferred airline, so don't hate on me too bad if I didn't include your go-to. 

Per regulations, every airline asks for volunteers to give up their spot for compensation. After that, airlines can set their own rules to decide who gets left behind. Now then, in no particular order...

**United Airlines** looks at several variables: Fare class, itinerary, status of frequent flyer program membership, and time of check-in without advanced seat assignment. Basically if you're not a loyal customer and/or early bird, you might not want to get too comfortable in your seat. [Read United's full policy here - Rule 25](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/contract-of-carriage.aspx#sec25)

**Southwest Airlines** is pretty simple. The person in the last boarding position will be denied boarding, regardless of fare. [Read Southwest's full policy here - Page 39](https://www.southwest.com/assets/pdfs/corporate-commitments/contract-of-carriage.pdf)

**American Airlines** bases the decision primarily on check-in time, but also takes severe hardships, fare paid, and frequent flyer status into consideration sometimes as well. [Read American's full policy here](https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/support/conditions-of-carriage.jsp#oversales)

**Delta Airlines** has a pretty complex policy. Essentially, if you paid a premium fare, you have nothing to worry about. That said, passengers with boarding passes are safer than those who don't have them or didn't check in. In those cases, rebooked passengers or frequent flyers are safer than a passenger who didn't check in and doesn't have a boarding pass. Exception: Special needs passengers (disabilities, unaccompanied minors, etc.) are likely good to go no matter what. [Read Delta's full policy here - Rule 245 on Page 42](http://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/legal/contract_of_carriage_dom.pdf)

**Frontier Airlines** has a policy about as simple as Southwest. Passengers who check in after all seats have been assigned won't get a seat. [Read Frontier's full policy here](https://www.flyfrontier.com/legal/contract-of-carriage/)

**Alaska Airlines** favors the early bird. Anyone with a confirmed seat assignment won't get booted. Don't have one? Show up early and you're more likely to get a seat. [Read Alaska's full policy here](https://www.alaskaair.com/~/media/Files/PDF/contract-of-carriage/Alaska-Airlines-Contract-of-Carriage.pdf?INT=AS_Legal_||20160816_CoC_ENG||)

**So you've been involuntarily bumped. Now what?** If they can still get you to your destination within an hour on a different flight, airlines aren't required to pay you anything. If you get there between 60-119 minutes after your scheduled arrival, you're owed 200% of the one-way fare (not to exceed $675). If you arrive 120 minutes or longer, you're owed 400% of the one-way fare (not to exceed $1350). There's other small print to go through, but that's the gist.

2023-08-06 18:05:19,Expeditionary report: connecting through MSP,"— 47 minutes to departure —

I leisurely stroll up to gate A8 and do a quick go-around, zooming up to A11 and back to A6 before circling back to A8. I do this 5 or 6 times with our baby’s stroller, hoping he’ll fall asleep. The smiley bastard is just waving at everyone though. 

— 39 minutes to departure —

My wife is at the gate counter. We didn’t have assigned seats because we booked with credit card points or something. I mosey up, and she mouths something about the lap infant ticket. 

We flew out of Austin that morning. This flight is the second leg, leaving from MSP (Minneapolis-Saint Paul). There had been some confusion this morning about the lap infant. The Austin attendant had quickly fixed the situation. As we walked off, she mentioned that there was a bug in the system with baby boys. 

That struck me as odd. A bug with lap infants, sure. But with male children specifically? Why did the code in Delta’s ticketing system rely, in some way, on the gender of the child? Are there different rules governing male and female babies? Had Delta refactored their entire codebase to accommodate the possibility of gender-less 1 year olds? What was going on?

I keep pushing the stroller up and down the terminal, consumed with the thought of gender variables in backend code.

— 31 minutes to departure —

Boarding begins. Active military personnel and families with children under the age of 5.

The flight is oversold. One of the ladies at the desk (The Trainee) picks up the intercom. She announces that they’re offering $800 cash (!!) to anyone who will take the later flight. How much later? Well, 12 hours later. But $800 is a lot…. I ask my wife if we should do it. We glance down at our baby, who has gotten out of the stroller and stuck his hand into the spoke of a wheelchair and started crying. You’d have to pay me a lot more than $800 to live in this airport for a day with this little two-foot terrorista.

The Trainee puts down the intercom and tells us that we should do it. She points out that we’d be getting paid $66/hour. I love being told what to do. And I love being told how to value my time when I’m traveling halfway across the country to see close friends. So this last ditch sales pitch almost seals the deal. But the baby is running off towards the moving walkway… 

— 24 minutes to departure —

Group 2 is allowed to board. My wife is still at the counter trying to resolve the infant lap ticket situation.

One passenger has agreed to take the $800 but they’re still looking for one more…

A very nice ground crew gentleman offers to fold up my stroller and take it down the jet bridge.

“— just hold on one second before you do that”

Another lady at the counter (The Lady With No Last Name) stops him. It’s not a foregone conclusion that we’re getting on this flight. But she and a third lady (The Typist) are furiously typing. They type type type type. Then throw up their hands in disbelief. Can you believe The System?! Disbelief is at an all time right now. It is practically oozing out of the computer at the gate. 

The baby and I leave, to continue to circle.

I recently went to Tacoma and really liked it. I also prefer Fort Worth to Dallas. Am I naturally drawn to the lesser of two joint metroplexes? What does that say about me? I keep walking, wondering whether I would like Saint Paul…

— 10 minutes to departure —

We are STILL trying to figure out the baby ticket.

This is when I start to tune in. Behind the counter we have three ladies: 1) The Lady With No Last Name, 2) The Trainee, 3) The Typist. The Lady With No Last Name explains that on Delta, the infant needs it’s own boarding pass. I would think that the answer is to print a boarding pass. But The System doesn’t allow that.

Why can’t we just… get on the plane? Well, everyone has to be accounted for. Obviously. It’s for safety reasons. You have to know how much weight is on the plane (This reason was actually floated. When I say “floated” I mean “authoritatively dictated” but I need a word that expresses a greater disconnection from reality, because our baby weighs 23 lbs, and a Boeing 737 weighs 91,000 lbs.)  

It’s at this point that I’m starting to wonder — if this problem hasn’t been solved in the last 30 minutes, what are the chances it gets solved in the next 10 minutes?

— 5 minutes to departure —

The Lady With No Last Name is on the phone with GAC. She says “GAC” like we all know what it means. I look it up. It’s the Delta Global Assistance Center, where the most elite, the most persistent, the most empathetic customer service workers wage war with… The System.

The Typist hasn’t looked up once from her computer. Maybe it’s because she is one with The System. Maybe it’s because she doesn’t like to look customers in the eyes as she fucks them. Whatever the reason, she is locked in.

But all of sudden The Typist exclaims, “The baby’s on!” Not sure what “on” means, given that we flew to Minneapolis on this same reservation an hour earlier, but whatever, we’re cooking!

But then The System burps out a guttural beep that, if it were a color, would be a very, very dark red. 

Her face says it all. This is bad.

“The bottle is on *both* their laps.” 

“The bottle” is code word for “lap infant”. Now, you might wonder why it’s a problem that “the bottle” is on both our laps. What could possibly be wrong with a phantom digital lap infant? Well, the problem, dear reader, is that your correspondent was seated in an exit row. And, as TSA-fearing Americans, we all know that babies cannot sit in exit rows. Even phantom digital clone babies. This is officially FUBAR.

So it’s back to GAC.

— 3 minutes to departure —

It’s at this point that the pressure gets ratcheted up. The Lady With No Last Name is the one on the phone with GAC. Everyone within shouting distance of Gate A8 knows to stay out of her fucking way. She is making her GAC her bitch. Now The Typist, on the other hand, is about to have a nervous breakdown. She’s just muttering to herself that we have to “close this flight”. She is not comfortable with the way The Lady With No Last Name is playing it fast and loose. I don’t like what I’m hearing from The Typist. The Trainee is just looking at The System in disbelief. The Lady With No Last Name is our only hope.

Someone from the plane (the pilot?) is now calling up to the desk. One problem — there’s only one phone line at the gate, so The Lady With No Last Name can’t put GAC on hold and take the call. She comes up with a plan — somebody should write down her cell phone number and run it down to the plane, so that she can take two calls at once. This is impressive to watch. Man and machine, working in harmony.

The Lady With No Last Name is begging someone to take down her cell phone number but NOBODY IS DOING ANYTHING. That’s when she panics. She just hangs up GAC and takes the call from the plane. Why hasn’t the flight been closed? It’s not your flight to close, the Lady With No Last Name tells the person on the plane. The Typist is just nodding, like yup this flight should be closed.

— 1 minute to departure —

The Lady With No Last Name wastes 2 precious minutes getting reconnected with GAC. GAC makes an update to The System. “The bottle is out of the exit row!” the Typist exclaims.

Now that I have a phantom digital baby off my lap, I can board the flight. Thank Christ.

“Oh no”

We all freeze.

“Bottle’s off mom too”

Fuck. GAC somehow purged the entire flight of digital babies.

— 1 minute PAST departure —

The Typist is about to have an aneurism. 

“This flight is officially delayed,” she says without looking up. Surely The System will not look favorably upon this. 

— 3 minutes past departure —

The Lady With No Last Name is in her element. She’s screaming at GAC and then she covers the phone and mouths “I’m doing everything I can for you guys.” 

But then GAC has had enough of her shit. GAC hangs up The Lady With No Last Name.

— 5 minutes past departure —

The Lady With No Last Name makes the final call — they’re closing the flight. We are not on it.

The really nice ground crew gentlemen is STILL STANDING THERE holding our stroller. He walks over and hands it to me, and mutters “sorry bro”.

— 6 minutes past departure —

Full meltdown. Not the baby, no, he’s still smiling, oblivious to the machinations of The System. It’s my wife. And the Lady With No Last Name. They’re at each other’s throats. I thought the Lady With No  Last Name was being nice to us when she was being mean to GAC. But now that she’s being mean to us, I think she’s just a generically mean person. Disappointing.

— 8 minutes past departure —

This exchange was amazing:

My wife: “So can we have the $1600?”
The Lady With No Last Name: “No, you weren’t a volunteer”
My wife: “Right! Because we were volunTOLD!”

— 10 minutes past departure —

“She should be fired.”

That’s what The Typist says about the lady in Austin, who quickly resolved our problem. “She should be fired for IILLEGALLY getting your baby onto that flight without a boarding pass.” 

Bill Simmons has a concept called The Tyson Zone, which describes the point at which a celebrity becomes so crazy that you’ll believe any headline about them. I need an analogous phrase that describes a situation where people are following the rules so blindly that they will follow ANY rule, no matter how absurd, before using an ounce of common sense. The only thing evokes this absurdity is the Soviet Union, as depicted in the miniseries Chernobyl (which is great, highly recommend), so, yea, we’re officially in the Chernobyl Zone now.

When you’re in the Chernobyl Zone, the rules and The System are what’s important. “Bottles” can’t be in exit rows. Everyone must be accounted for. This situation is actually our fault (wow, really?) for not figuring this out beforehand. (Funny because my wife actually called the day before and they told us — lol! — to let the gate agents sort it out) And people who don’t obey the rules? They should be FIRED. 

Does the customer matter? Lol, we’re in the Chernobyl Zone, and the Geiger Counter is about to explode.

God forbid somebody let me sit in the exit row with a phantom digital baby in my lap. God forbid somebody walk down the jetbridge and take a palette of bottled water of the plane, to offset our 23 pound baby, which could take down this 91,000-pound aircraft. God forbid that somebody offer us an apology afterwards and just admit that Delta fucked us today. God forbid that somebody help us book the next flight (the one we didn’t volunteer for).

Why does the Lady With No Last Name have no last name? She has no last name because my wife asked for her last name, and she refused to give it to her. So you win. You win, Lady With No Last Name. Not only is your last name unknown, I’ve redacted your first name as well. 

Really, this is an ode to you. This is an ode to you and all the other zombie airline workers, who live in the Chernobyl Zone, punching buttons, “closing flights”, deleting “bottles”, and diligently doing 9 million different things other than listening to your customers, who are standing right in front of you, begging to be heard, with comically low expectations that are incredibly easy to meet.

I would say I’m never flying Delta again, but we all know the truth, which is that the other airlines are just as bad. The entire industry is in the Chernobyl Zone. Think about Southwest Airlines. First-come first-serve is a very reasonable principle. You show up earlier, you make things easier for the group, you deserve a better seat. And it made perfect sense for Southwest Airlines in the 1980s, when travelers checked in at the airport. But today, travelers check in online. So, first-come first-serve no longer makes any sense. Why would someone deserve a better seat for checking in 24 hours ahead versus 23 hours ahead? It doesn’t make any sense. But of course, that’s how we operate in the Chernobyl Zone. The customer should set a phone alarm 24 hours before their flight, because that’s a lovely customer experience. And it’s valuable to everybody. 

Think about this — what is every traveler’s most dreaded interaction? It’s putting a 52 pound bag on the scale at 6 AM and then looking sideways at the desk agent, like “C’mon bitch, are you really gonna fuck me right now?” Just a little blood pressure spike to get you in a really bad mood. That’s a lovely customer experience, and it’s one that is manufactured by the airline. It could be so easily removed by any manner of policies (e.g. you simply pay a dollar per pound).

What about the fact that every Airline website — actually I can’t talk about the websites or I’ll have an aneurism too.

If this were just some shitty startup, it wouldn’t bother me, but, as Ben Hunt has pointed out, Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta, has pocketed $134M worth of Delta stock since 2016 (it’s probably more by now). What the fuck does this man do? Has he ever talked to a customer? Better question — has he ever flown on Delta? And look, I know it’s hard to take the customer’s point of view, God I know it’s hard. But if you’re getting paid $134 million, you should be the Steve Jobs of airline kiosks. Not some stock buyback, pencil-pushing pussy.

You know, I will say, I do appreciate the budget airlines. At least they’re honest about the fact that they’re delivering a 2/10 experience. I recently got caught in a storm in Fort Lauderdale, and Spirit offered to rebook me on a 27 hour trip back to Austin that connected through Seattle and someplace else. All for like $30. It was great. It was really great. Obviously I didn’t do it, but I could feel them trying to get me somewhere, even if it was an endearingly absurd itinerary. So thank you Spirit. I guess that’s what I’m trying to say here. I love the Big Front Seat. I love the camaraderie on those flights. Stay honest, and I’ll keep loving you.",0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15jw695/expeditionary_report_connecting_through_msp/,"Expeditionary report: connecting through MSP — 47 minutes to departure —

I leisurely stroll up to gate A8 and do a quick go-around, zooming up to A11 and back to A6 before circling back to A8. I do this 5 or 6 times with our baby’s stroller, hoping he’ll fall asleep. The smiley bastard is just waving at everyone though. 

— 39 minutes to departure —

My wife is at the gate counter. We didn’t have assigned seats because we booked with credit card points or something. I mosey up, and she mouths something about the lap infant ticket. 

We flew out of Austin that morning. This flight is the second leg, leaving from MSP (Minneapolis-Saint Paul). There had been some confusion this morning about the lap infant. The Austin attendant had quickly fixed the situation. As we walked off, she mentioned that there was a bug in the system with baby boys. 

That struck me as odd. A bug with lap infants, sure. But with male children specifically? Why did the code in Delta’s ticketing system rely, in some way, on the gender of the child? Are there different rules governing male and female babies? Had Delta refactored their entire codebase to accommodate the possibility of gender-less 1 year olds? What was going on?

I keep pushing the stroller up and down the terminal, consumed with the thought of gender variables in backend code.

— 31 minutes to departure —

Boarding begins. Active military personnel and families with children under the age of 5.

The flight is oversold. One of the ladies at the desk (The Trainee) picks up the intercom. She announces that they’re offering $800 cash (!!) to anyone who will take the later flight. How much later? Well, 12 hours later. But $800 is a lot…. I ask my wife if we should do it. We glance down at our baby, who has gotten out of the stroller and stuck his hand into the spoke of a wheelchair and started crying. You’d have to pay me a lot more than $800 to live in this airport for a day with this little two-foot terrorista.

The Trainee puts down the intercom and tells us that we should do it. She points out that we’d be getting paid $66/hour. I love being told what to do. And I love being told how to value my time when I’m traveling halfway across the country to see close friends. So this last ditch sales pitch almost seals the deal. But the baby is running off towards the moving walkway… 

— 24 minutes to departure —

Group 2 is allowed to board. My wife is still at the counter trying to resolve the infant lap ticket situation.

One passenger has agreed to take the $800 but they’re still looking for one more…

A very nice ground crew gentleman offers to fold up my stroller and take it down the jet bridge.

“— just hold on one second before you do that”

Another lady at the counter (The Lady With No Last Name) stops him. It’s not a foregone conclusion that we’re getting on this flight. But she and a third lady (The Typist) are furiously typing. They type type type type. Then throw up their hands in disbelief. Can you believe The System?! Disbelief is at an all time right now. It is practically oozing out of the computer at the gate. 

The baby and I leave, to continue to circle.

I recently went to Tacoma and really liked it. I also prefer Fort Worth to Dallas. Am I naturally drawn to the lesser of two joint metroplexes? What does that say about me? I keep walking, wondering whether I would like Saint Paul…

2017-09-28 14:07:22,Travel Hints & Tips. How the airline industry works.,"**Before you read the post, keep in mind that may not be relevant for someone who travels a few times during the year domestically within the United States to see family or for work. On the other hand the article was based and targeting international travelers. This is for someone who travels from the United States to anywhere else in the world (Europe, Middle East, India, Asia and other popular to the airlines markets) to see family (ethnic groups) or simply vacationing.**


Back in the 80s and 90s shopping for air tickets was so much simpler. The airlines used to offer 3 fares. One for economy, one for business and one for first (for the airlines that offered it.) Everyone traveling economy for example would pay the same. (so no one was upset for paying more than the person next to them or some cousin who was bragging that paid less…) The reason about this was that when the tickets were “paper” and were physical items most agencies would pre-purchase and then set a price of how much they wanted to sell for the traveling season. (which also leaded to black market too in some cases. Having strong ethnic agencies that used to monopolize their markets, buying huge amounts of ticket stock and selling it to higher prices with huge margin of profit since they could do that. They could buy lots of ticket stock, make reservations and be able to hold them for weeks (can’t do this now), or book fake names to hold the space in flights and then change the name to whoever was traveling since there was so easy and without fees to change the names of the travelers.


What changed?


The airlines hated the fact of scheduling flights that could cost thousands of dollars without knowing if the flights will be full and sometimes sending half empty planes. They removed the paper tickets and changed the game. They introduced the “classes of service”! If let’s say on a flight there are 300 seats, and the cabins are broken down to 30 business class tickets, 70 premium economy and 200 economy tickets, each cabin is broken down to classes of service. Economy for example, those 200 seats are divided to a dozen of different economy fares that change every 9 tickets are sold. Example 9A 9B 9C 9D 9E 9F 9G. The first 9 people will call they will buy at the price of the A class that may be $800, next 9 travelers will pay the higher tier economy, B which may be $900 etc. The highest economy may be at $1800-2000 and this is the same cabin and the same seats that someone paid probably $800 or less. The way this system works, benefits the airlines since the travelers must rush and try to buy way ahead of time to make sure they ll get the lowest economy class of service or else they will end up paying way more. The travelers cant wait till last moment anymore when there was only one economy fare out there. So it is a game between all of us the travelers. Whoever calls first and the earliest gets the good fares. On top of that, when you make get a reservation now days, you cant hold it for more than 1-2 days. (before the agents could hold them for weeks). Not to mention the penalties. Most tickets are non refundable (with an exception of death). All tickets have penalties when you try to change them and the list going on. Keep in mind in domestic and international tickets, the lowest ones (lowest classes of service) come with some harsh rules behind them. Such as you don’t get miles or you can accumulate a very low amount of them. You are not allowed to travel with a luggage (unless you pay extra at the airport). Usually those tickets are non refundable and non changeable. (If you must change something, then you lose the ticket and you have to buy new one). Not to mention you can pre-select your seating assignment. 


When buying tickets be very careful. For domestic traveling always go directly to the airlines. They keep that portion of market for themselves. Which means, you aren’t going to get a better deal anywhere else. For international traveling though, all the airlines are giving a big portion of their deals and discounted fares to consolidators and wholesalers that they provide smaller agencies and websites with airfares. So when it comes to international traveling, then you may get a lower fare from an A Airline via an agency or a website than the airline itself. (Because the A Airline may have an agreement with the B travel agency to give them the right and sell their discounted deals). Many are complaining about the fares and fees. Well traveling is not a cheap “sport” any more. As about the competition, well, someone may say “but there are so many airlines”. True, but most of these airlines have merged into bigger alliances. The world’s major carriers have merged into 3-4 big groups that they expanded their “city service networks” and share price and policies. So instead for 20-30 airlines, they are basically 3. So for us the consumers, we get the one or the two of them from each city. (this mean we get 1 or 2 fares to pick from) The one or the other airline alliance. (some major cities are luckier because they may get all 3 alliances plus some other ethnic carriers that don’t belong to any of the big groups and they are just offering an extra choice of airfare. 


Seating Assignment has become a joke too now days. It used to be free, yet the past years the airlines discovered this idea to sell the seating pre-assignment. You buy your tickets on April to travel in June and you want to assign the seats. You have to pay a fee. (Makes me wonder what we will pay next). Luckily you can go get the free seat assignment at the airport the day of your departure.
Travel insurance. Often I get asked about it. Another way for the agencies to make profit. Most airlines and the trip insurances waive and forgive penalties if you are very sick. But only if you are sick. Neither the airlines nor the travel insurance will cover you for any other reason. (yet many don’t realize this and buy insurance anyways). Some major airlines will cover you and waive the fees if you are really sick, so no reason to buy any insurance. Unless of course you booked with one of the few carriers that do not accept medical reasons for cancellations or changes. Then it is worth it. Although most of the times it is a waste of money. You end up paying way too much and sometimes it is not needed if the airline covers you for medical reasons anyways. 
Nothing is guaranteed either. Penalties, fares, fees, all are subject to change. Even your paid seating assignment. Basically the airlines under their guidelines can do anything they want and you can’t do a thing about it. 


When you try to book keep in mind to search for at least 4-5 months in advance from the month you want to travel. (this is for international tickets, not domestic tickets within the U.S.) The airlines have introduced this term called “advance purchase” which it works to discourage travelers and overcharges them if they try to call within a week or two from their desired departure date to buy tickets. If let’s say an economy ticket cost $1000 (if you book it a month or more in advance). If you try to buy the same ticket within three or four weeks, or like sometimes people do, within one or two weeks the price skyrockets. That same ticket ends up costing $2000-$3000. So try avoiding booking within a week or two and last minute tickets. It was a time that worked well for deals, but not anymore. 


So what about the Special Sales?

Good ticket hunting.",7,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/730arx/travel_hints_tips_how_the_airline_industry_works/,"Travel Hints & Tips. How the airline industry works. **Before you read the post, keep in mind that may not be relevant for someone who travels a few times during the year domestically within the United States to see family or for work. On the other hand the article was based and targeting international travelers. This is for someone who travels from the United States to anywhere else in the world (Europe, Middle East, India, Asia and other popular to the airlines markets) to see family (ethnic groups) or simply vacationing.**


Back in the 80s and 90s shopping for air tickets was so much simpler. The airlines used to offer 3 fares. One for economy, one for business and one for first (for the airlines that offered it.) Everyone traveling economy for example would pay the same. (so no one was upset for paying more than the person next to them or some cousin who was bragging that paid less…) The reason about this was that when the tickets were “paper” and were physical items most agencies would pre-purchase and then set a price of how much they wanted to sell for the traveling season. (which also leaded to black market too in some cases. Having strong ethnic agencies that used to monopolize their markets, buying huge amounts of ticket stock and selling it to higher prices with huge margin of profit since they could do that. They could buy lots of ticket stock, make reservations and be able to hold them for weeks (can’t do this now), or book fake names to hold the space in flights and then change the name to whoever was traveling since there was so easy and without fees to change the names of the travelers.


What changed?


The airlines hated the fact of scheduling flights that could cost thousands of dollars without knowing if the flights will be full and sometimes sending half empty planes. They removed the paper tickets and changed the game. They introduced the “classes of service”! If let’s say on a flight there are 300 seats, and the cabins are broken down to 30 business class tickets, 70 premium economy and 200 economy tickets, each cabin is broken down to classes of service. Economy for example, those 200 seats are divided to a dozen of different economy fares that change every 9 tickets are sold. Example 9A 9B 9C 9D 9E 9F 9G. The first 9 people will call they will buy at the price of the A class that may be $800, next 9 travelers will pay the higher tier economy, B which may be $900 etc. The highest economy may be at $1800-2000 and this is the same cabin and the same seats that someone paid probably $800 or less. The way this system works, benefits the airlines since the travelers must rush and try to buy way ahead of time to make sure they ll get the lowest economy class of service or else they will end up paying way more. The travelers cant wait till last moment anymore when there was only one economy fare out there. So it is a game between all of us the travelers. Whoever calls first and the earliest gets the good fares. On top of that, when you make get a reservation now days, you cant hold it for more than 1-2 days. (before the agents could hold them for weeks). Not to mention the penalties. Most tickets are non refundable (with an exception of death). All tickets have penalties when you try to change them and the list going on. Keep in mind in domestic and international tickets, the lowest ones (lowest classes of service) come with some harsh rules behind them. Such as you don’t get miles or you can accumulate a very low amount of them. You are not allowed to travel with a luggage (unless you pay extra at the airport). Usually those tickets are non refundable and non changeable. (If you must change something, then you lose the ticket and you have to buy new one). Not to mention you can pre-select your seating assignment. 


When buying tickets be very careful. For domestic traveling always go directly to the airlines. They keep that portion of market for themselves. Which means, you aren’t going to get a better deal anywhere else. For international traveling though, all the airlines are giving a big portion of their deals and discounted fares to consolidators and wholesalers that they provide smaller agencies and websites with airfares. So when it comes to international traveling, then you may get a lower fare from an A Airline via an agency or a website than the airline itself. (Because the A Airline may have an agreement with the B travel agency to give them the right and sell their discounted deals). Many are complaining about the fares and fees. Well traveling is not a cheap “sport” any more. As about the competition, well, someone may say “but there are so many airlines”. True, but most of these airlines have merged into bigger alliances. The world’s major carriers have merged into 3-4 big groups that they expanded their “city service networks” and share price and policies. So instead for 20-30 airlines, they are basically 3. So for us the consumers, we get the one or the two of them from each city. (this mean we get 1 or 2 fares to pick from) The one or the other airline alliance. (some major cities are luckier because they may get all 3 alliances plus some other ethnic carriers that don’t belong to any of the big groups and they are just offering an extra choice of airfare. 


Seating Assignment has become a joke too now days. It used to be free, yet the past years the airlines discovered this idea to sell the seating pre-assignment. You buy your tickets on April to travel in June and you want to assign the seats. You have to pay a fee. (Makes me wonder what we will pay next). Luckily you can go get the free seat assignment at the airport the day of your departure.
Travel insurance. Often I get asked about it. Another way for the agencies to make profit. Most airlines and the trip insurances waive and forgive penalties if you are very sick. But only if you are sick. Neither the airlines nor the travel insurance will cover you for any other reason. (yet many don’t realize this and buy insurance anyways). Some major airlines will cover you and waive the fees if you are really sick, so no reason to buy any insurance. Unless of course you booked with one of the few carriers that do not accept medical reasons for cancellations or changes. Then it is worth it. Although most of the times it is a waste of money. You end up paying way too much and sometimes it is not needed if the airline covers you for medical reasons anyways. 
Nothing is guaranteed either. Penalties, fares, fees, all are subject to change. Even your paid seating assignment. Basically the airlines under their guidelines can do anything they want and you can’t do a thing about it. 


When you try to book keep in mind to search for at least 4-5 months in advance from the month you want to travel. (this is for international tickets, not domestic tickets within the U.S.) The airlines have introduced this term called “advance purchase” which it works to discourage travelers and overcharges them if they try to call within a week or two from their desired departure date to buy tickets. If let’s say an economy ticket cost $1000 (if you book it a month or more in advance). If you try to buy the same ticket within three or four weeks, or like sometimes people do, within one or two weeks the price skyrockets. That same ticket ends up costing $2000-$3000. So try avoiding booking within a week or two and last minute tickets. It was a time that worked well for deals, but not anymore. 


So what about the Special Sales?


Prices go down once in a while too, as sales/demand mandates. The airlines monitor their flights and once the sales drop, in order for the to fill the flights they release ""special sales"" to fill up the flights. Remember the goal is to send the aircraft full.

2024-03-12 17:21:45,Saudia Airlines Infant Baggage Allowance and seat allocation Manchester UK,"Hi everyone

I am flying out via Saudia on Thursday with a five month old, whose ticket was 10% of the fare price of an adult. 

I haven’t been able to get a clear answer from Saudia UK helpline nor on their website, I’ve seen on the Saudi site infants get the same allowance on one FAQ section whilst another place it states 10% fare infants do not get any allowance. 

My questions are as follows:-

- how much checked luggage does an infant get and how much carry on?
- I understand that a stroller is free above and beyond any allowance - does anyone know if it is taken on board (my stroller is compact enough) if that’s counted as an additional infant allowance for free? Just don’t want to be without it after arrival whilst going through immigration at the airport before I go to luggage collection. 
- I’ve managed to check in online hoping I would get to choose my seats but alas - they have assigned me seats. Would I be able to change it at the airport or should I cancel my online check in? Then I’m thinking, what benefit has this given me really since I still have to check my luggage in. I’m ideally looking for the front seats to get a bassinet. 
- anyone know what time check in desk opens? As in how long before the flight time

2023-03-10 04:12:56,Partner no longer coming… how can I switch my middle seat to his aisle seat Turkish Airlines?,"
Hi all, my partner and I have two tickets in extra room economy for a round trip flight from SFO to IST in the beginning of April: he is assigned the aisle seat and I am in the middle seat next to him; they were the same price.  These tickets are non refundable.

He is not coming anymore.  Even though the ticket is non refundable, if we call and cancel the ticket ahead of time, he can either be refunded at least the taxes and fees ($500) or get an “open ticket” to use later which he doesn’t necessarily care about.

Ideally we’d like to do that (cancel and get the $500) and then switch my middle seat to his now available aisle seat, but it’s seeming like there’s no way to do this per customer service.  

I’m even thinking of not telling them, him being a no show, taking his seat and then having my middle one be empty, but I realize once the airline realizes he’s not there his aisle seat will be up for grabs to standby passengers.

Is there anyway I can just take his damn seat!?  They’re not making this easy and I’m super frustrated.

2019-10-14 04:50:24,"Spirit Airlines, Big Front Seat info for fat people","Hi, Reddit.
If I had a blog, I'd put this there.  I don't, and that's why I'm leaving this here.

This is just info for anyone wanting to find out more about Spirit Airlines Big Front Seats.

I wanted to find out this info before I took my trip, and couldn't find the answers anywhere. Now when someone does a search, this post will pop up.

I am a huge person.
I am 5'9"" tall.  
I don't want to type on here how much I weigh, but it's a lot lot lot.  I'm definitely one of the fattest people you'll see walking around.  No exaggeration.

I recently decided to fly to Vegas.  I did not want to encroach on anyone sitting next to me, so did a lot of research on seat sizes.  It looked to me like Spirit Airlines Big Front Seat would be big enough for me, so I booked it.

Short answer:  It was big enough!!!

Some of the seats have airbags.  Don't book those.  The belt buckle will not meet if you have a massive waist like mine.  If in doubt, don't.  I thought I'd be able to buckle the belt with the airbag because I can still get the seatbelts in cars to click if I squirm and squeeze enough.  Nope.  Too short.  The seatbelt extender I bought on amazon and brought along on the flight worked on the non-airbag seats, but the airbag seat buckle had been modified specifically so an extender could not be attached.

The front-est seats on Spirit do have slightly more legroom and are easiest to get into.  But if you're a fat person like me, book the ""Big Front Seat"" farther back that doesn't have the airbag seatbelt.  The advantage of the ""big front seat"" that's in the 2nd or 4th row in the plane (or whatever) is that there is room there for you to keep your bag with you rather than having to put it in the overhead. No bags are allowed in the front-est seats.

The Big front Seats are two seats side by side.  I chose a window seat, and was glad I did.  There was plenty of room between me and the window for my arm fat to drape over, and I was not crowded.

On the side with the shared armrest, I would've been taking about 3/4 of the armrest if I had just sat normally. I did not want to encroach, though, so brought along a belt to loop around that arm & my torso to tie it in closer.  That way I could still rest, but my arm was held inside my own ""zone"" of space.

The legs were no problem.  I wasn't sure if there'd be enough leg room not to encroach, but there was a big plenty.  No problem at all. There were also extra inches between my knees and the seat in front of me, so I would think even if you're huge like me, you'd still fit in the seat if you're 6'5.   I think if you were skinny (no big butt) you'd probably still have leg room even if you're a seven-footer.

Now.  Here's a warning for you:

When I booked my round trip ticket, I picked a Big front Seat and paid for it.  Golden, right?  Not so much.  When I printed my boarding pass the morning of the trip, the flight to Vegas had me listed for the big front seat, but the return boarding pass had me assigned to one of the seats farther back.

Nightmare.

Of course there's no way I'd fit.

I called Spirit in a panic and actually got through to someone.
She couldn't assign me a big front seat, they were all sold.  She couldn't sell me two seats, the plane was full.

Nightmare.

She ended up booking me in a ""priority"" seat. It's a seat with armrests that lift & that are set aside for people traveling with pets.  I was told the seat had more room than other three-per-row seats, and it was the best they could do.

Climbed on the return flight and **it was bad.**
I came nowhere near fitting in that priority seat.  There was no extra room between me and the window as there had been in the big front seat. I was encroaching on my neighbor A LOT. It felt like I was encroaching 1/2 of their seat, and maybe I was.
 I couldn't even move in the seat to put my bag on the floor. 
My knees were jammed up tight into the seat in front of me. The seats are thin. Must've been miserable for that person, as well.

Luckily, the flight had been delayed, and some people had decided to make other arrangements. The flight was no longer full. The couple who'd been assigned the seats next to me were able to shift to a private row where they were all alone, too.  This meant I had three seats to spread out in.  Honestly, I needed them.  I could've made do with 2, but having three allowed me to spread out my knees and be comfortable. There wouldn't have been sufficient knee room if I were limited to two seats - the person in front of me would've felt my knee in their back.

So.
Turned out to be a great trip.
I'll happily fly Spirit again.
Next time, I'm gonna make darn sure I have confirmation that I'm booked in that big front seat both going and coming as soon as I book the tickets.  I think it was a glitch in their ap, and I'm hoping they have it fixed, soon.  Do take the time to call & stay on hold to confirm you're in the big front seat both ways.

Oh.
Pitch.
The pitch of the big front seat was comfy for me. No worries.
The pitch of the three-per-row seats was lowsy. Backache within 1/2 hour.  

Thanks for reading.
I'm not on reddit often, anymore, so please forgive if you ask a question in the comments or messages and I don't get back to you promptly.  I will answer when I can.

Best.

2024-10-27 17:28:08,"Flew Lufthansa for the first time (multiple flights), will try to avoid them in the future. Here are my impressions.","What a trashfire of an airline Lufthansa is!

I've flown a lot over the years - since I started keeping track, I have 420 flight segments listed, but there were plenty more before that.  The majority of my flights have been on US and European airlines, but I've also flown on some others.  Until a couple of months ago, I had never flown Lufthansa.

I don't fly super low cost carriers like Wiz and Ryanair, and I expected Lufthansa to be a solid, normal airline like the ones I'm used to.  It wasn't.

My trip was a two week open jaw, with two segments on each flight day, so six segments total, on three different weekends, going to/from four different countries.  All six segments were Lufthansa-operated, not codeshares on some other carrier.  Because of that, I think I got a good general sense of what Lufthansa is like, not a fluke.  What it's like is not at all what I want to deal with in the future.

Now, the flights themselves did go pretty much as scheduled, I got where I was going, and so did the bags (though with a very long wait a couple of times).  That's what I normally expect and what normally happens with other airlines.  Frankfurt airport, where I had to transfer twice, is pretty awful - huge, poorly signed, hard to get around.  Lufthansa's planes on both occasions were located far from the terminal, requiring a bus ride of more than ten minutes _after_ you ""board"" past the gate (yes, I timed it the second time, out of curiosity).  The other time I transferred through Munich, which was more of a normal airport experience.

So there's the best I can say about Lufthansa - they did fly me to where I was supposed to go, and got my bags there.  And I expect they do the necessary maintenance to keep their planes safe, and in working condition.

On the interior, though, their planes seem like they were made many decades ago and not really maintained, let alone upgraded.

* On two of the six segments I flew, the seatback pocket in front of me had come undone on the bottom, so anything you placed in it could just fall through to the floor.

* _None_ of the six planes I flew on had power outlets or USB charge ports, even the transatlantic flights, although a couple of them had what seem to be decoy USB ports - you could plug a USB into them, but no power.  Yes, I tried multiple USB cords to make sure.

* They didn't offer movies and other entertainment on in-flight wifi, instead they had those tiny screens on the back of the seat in front of you like planes used to have 20 years ago.

* Although I rarely need to go to the bathroom in the middle of a flight, I did on one of these Lufthansa flights, and found that of the 4 lavatories in our main cabin section, two had no water and were therefore effectively out of use (with hand-written paper signs taped to the doors to let you know), which means I had to wait in line for a while even though it was the middle of the flight and few people were using them.  Maybe this was a fluke and their lavatories are kept in good repair on all their other planes, but somehow I doubt that.

Overall, it just feels like they've let these planes deteriorate for decades, putting in minimal effort to maybe fix some of the most egregious problems, and just aren't upgrading them.  All six different planes I was on, on three different weekends, going to or from different countries, which makes me pretty confident that this is the general sad state of their fleet.

But where Lufthansa really shines is what comes before the flight - web site, booking, seat selection, checkin, and so on.  They not only were the worst at all of this of ANY airline I've ever flown, but they were so far worse that they're in a whole different category, where no other airline comes anywhere close.  Let me list the ways, minor and major:

* Their web site is impressively slow, which makes a lot of their other problems more frustrating, especially since they require you to do a lot of things on their web site as separate operations that you'd normally not have to do with other airlines.

* If you make a booking when not logged in to your account, you _cannot_ add it to your account even if it's under your name.  You have to look it up by name and locator (code) every single time.  Most other airline web sites let you ""import"" a booking if yours by entering the locator once, and then it shows up in your account.

* When you book and by tickets, you get an email sent to you with the itinerary ... but no hint of what you paid!

* Getting this ""receipt"" - a record of what you paid - is an adventure.  Reservations customer service cannot get their system to email you a ""receipt"", they say the only way to do it is by requesting a receipt on the web site.  To request a receipt on the web site, you have to enter the ""document number"", which is NOT your reservation locator (that 6 number/letter code).  For your flight reservation itself, the document number is the ticket number, which is on the ticket, but you can't view your ticket when logged in on the web site.  Even worse, though, is that paid seat selection and paid checked baggage are totally separate items with their own separate document numbers and separate receipts.  You cannot get a single itemization of what you paid for all of it.

* You can't add passport information to your account, to have it automatically added for all your flights.  You have to enter all of your passport information for each online check-in.  I also tried calling reservations customer service to see if they could add my passport information, and they said no I need to do it online.  Okay, how do I do it online, I asked - I can't find it on the web site?  Turns out they can't help with the web site, for that I have to call their ""web support"", but web support is only open during working hours on weekdays.  And it turns out they were giving me false information anyway - as I noted earlier, you actually can't do it on their web site, their reservations people just don't seem to know that.

* Speaking of online check-in, what a mess!  First of all, each check-in requires filling out a lot of information (such as your passport details) on forms that span multiple pages.  Given that it can take 30+ seconds for a single page to load, that's bad enough.  It's even worse when you're traveling and using bad hotel wifi or a roaming cell hotspot, and it can take many minutes for a page to load.  If you've gotten to the 6th page of the check-in and it fails there, you have to go back to the beginning to try again.

* Their system made me check in separately for each segment of a flight, even if I was flying A to B to C on the same day on the same reservation.

* Check in failed at the end of the process multiple times, with a message saying ""Something went wrong. We are currently experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again later.""  This happened to me on, I think, three different check-ins.  When it gives that message, there's a button to cancel check-in, but no other options.  I found out eventually that if you don't click that button, you are actually checked in.

* ... but when you are actually checked-in, the invitation to check in for the flight still appears when you are logged in and looking at the main page.  If you click that link, then it gives you an error, and that error is because you've already checked in.

* Oh, and you can't copy and paste must of the passenger information, for either booking or check-in, because they use auto-collapsing boxes that only show up when you mouse over them and seem to prevent pasting.

* They have a web chat that's supposedly there to help with web issues, but every time I tried it it, when I actually typed in a question, the response was always ""I'm sorry, a technical error occurred. Please try again.""  Every time.

* Also it kept telling me I needed to enter passenger contact information, even though all the passenger contact information was there.  Whenever I would confirm that the information was correct, it would tell me it was incomplete, and the red message to fill in passenger contact information never went away.

But the worse part was seats.  Because I was flying an open jaw and my partner was just doing a round trip, we were going to share the same three segments at first, and then my remaining segments were on my own.  So I made separate reservations for us, and paid to select seats, to seat us together.

THEY KEPT CANCELLING OUR SEATS.

Seriously, this happened for every single flight, for both of us.  Sometimes several times for the same flight.  On one flight, our seats were cancelled FOUR times, in the four weeks between when I booked and when we flew.  Each time, I had to go back through their web sites slow loading and counterintuitive UI to re-select our seats, and sometimes pay the difference if they were more expensive.

Sometimes, they moved us to different seats, so we still had seats, but not where we'd selected.  A couple of times we ended up together in the new seats, but the other times, they put us in different parts of the plane.  Other times, one or the other of us lost seat assignment altogether, and didn't have any seat selected at all.  One of those times, when I selected a new seat that cost the same as the original one, I had to pay again for it, because the credit didn't transfer.  I was able to get the credit to transfer only by calling customer service; they were able to look and see that I had already paid the same amount for a seat and then lost it, so I shouldn't have to pay again this time.  But they kept doing this over and over and over, so it meant I had to start checking their web site every few days just to make sure we hadn't lost our seats again, or to grab them back quickly in case they had, before someone else got them.

I know sometimes airlines have to move your paid seat if they have to change aircraft and the new aircraft has a different seat arrangement, but that's very rare.  I've had it happen maybe 1 out of 100 flights on other airlines.  Here it happened over 10 times (for two people, so over 20 seats de-assigned or moved) for just this one trip, including 4 times for a single flight segment ... and nearly every time, the same seats we'd lost were still available so I could re-select them, and the seatmap looked completely identical.

When I griped about this to the group we were with at our first destination, a couple who were also flying Lufthansa checked their seats for their return flights and told us the same had happened to them, and they needed to re-select their seats.

Oh, and to add a little bonus to all of this, for our return flight where I had to fix the seats the day before we flew, the we portal then showed the wrong seats - not the ones I'd just re-selected.  I thought we were seated apart again, and called customer service, who refused to help (even though we'd paid for the seats together).  I figured I'd try to fix it at the airport desk, but then it turned out we actually did get the seats I paid for and the web site was just lying.",181,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gdg9r5/flew_lufthansa_for_the_first_time_multiple/,"Flew Lufthansa for the first time (multiple flights), will try to avoid them in the future. Here are my impressions. What a trashfire of an airline Lufthansa is!

I've flown a lot over the years - since I started keeping track, I have 420 flight segments listed, but there were plenty more before that.  The majority of my flights have been on US and European airlines, but I've also flown on some others.  Until a couple of months ago, I had never flown Lufthansa.

I don't fly super low cost carriers like Wiz and Ryanair, and I expected Lufthansa to be a solid, normal airline like the ones I'm used to.  It wasn't.

My trip was a two week open jaw, with two segments on each flight day, so six segments total, on three different weekends, going to/from four different countries.  All six segments were Lufthansa-operated, not codeshares on some other carrier.  Because of that, I think I got a good general sense of what Lufthansa is like, not a fluke.  What it's like is not at all what I want to deal with in the future.

Now, the flights themselves did go pretty much as scheduled, I got where I was going, and so did the bags (though with a very long wait a couple of times).  That's what I normally expect and what normally happens with other airlines.  Frankfurt airport, where I had to transfer twice, is pretty awful - huge, poorly signed, hard to get around.  Lufthansa's planes on both occasions were located far from the terminal, requiring a bus ride of more than ten minutes _after_ you ""board"" past the gate (yes, I timed it the second time, out of curiosity).  The other time I transferred through Munich, which was more of a normal airport experience.

So there's the best I can say about Lufthansa - they did fly me to where I was supposed to go, and got my bags there.  And I expect they do the necessary maintenance to keep their planes safe, and in working condition.

On the interior, though, their planes seem like they were made many decades ago and not really maintained, let alone upgraded.

* On two of the six segments I flew, the seatback pocket in front of me had come undone on the bottom, so anything you placed in it could just fall through to the floor.

* _None_ of the six planes I flew on had power outlets or USB charge ports, even the transatlantic flights, although a couple of them had what seem to be decoy USB ports - you could plug a USB into them, but no power.  Yes, I tried multiple USB cords to make sure.

* They didn't offer movies and other entertainment on in-flight wifi, instead they had those tiny screens on the back of the seat in front of you like planes used to have 20 years ago.

* Although I rarely need to go to the bathroom in the middle of a flight, I did on one of these Lufthansa flights, and found that of the 4 lavatories in our main cabin section, two had no water and were therefore effectively out of use (with hand-written paper signs taped to the doors to let you know), which means I had to wait in line for a while even though it was the middle of the flight and few people were using them.  Maybe this was a fluke and their lavatories are kept in good repair on all their other planes, but somehow I doubt that.

Overall, it just feels like they've let these planes deteriorate for decades, putting in minimal effort to maybe fix some of the most egregious problems, and just aren't upgrading them.  All six different planes I was on, on three different weekends, going to or from different countries, which makes me pretty confident that this is the general sad state of their fleet.

But where Lufthansa really shines is what comes before the flight - web site, booking, seat selection, checkin, and so on.  They not only were the worst at all of this of ANY airline I've ever flown, but they were so far worse that they're in a whole different category, where no other airline comes anywhere close.  Let me list the ways, minor and major:

* Their web site is impressively slow, which makes a lot of their other problems more frustrating, especially since they require you to do a lot of things on their web site as separate operations that you'd normally not have to do with other airlines.

* If you make a booking when not logged in to your account, you _cannot_ add it to your account even if it's under your name.  You have to look it up by name and locator (code) every single time.  Most other airline web sites let you ""import"" a booking if yours by entering the locator once, and then it shows up in your account.

* When you book and by tickets, you get an email sent to you with the itinerary ... but no hint of what you paid!

* Getting this ""receipt"" - a record of what you paid - is an adventure.  Reservations customer service cannot get their system to email you a ""receipt"", they say the only way to do it is by requesting a receipt on the web site.  To request a receipt on the web site, you have to enter the ""document number"", which is NOT your reservation locator (that 6 number/letter code).  For your flight reservation itself, the document number is the ticket number, which is on the ticket, but you can't view your ticket when logged in on the web site.

2023-01-30 18:37:46,Airline policies for flying with a kid under 12 (aka family seating for 2 people),"Backstory: On my last trip in Europe we had several flights where my newly-2yo child was seated in a different row than me. I was surprised this would happen, but how airlines manage seating of small children varies a lot by airline. I got a lot of flak from people especially about not buying seating even though buying a seat doesn't guarantee adjacent seating. This isn't the issue, IMO, it's lack of a clear policy and enforcement of that policy in the ticketing and seat selection process. This isn't about having a family sit together, it's about seating a small child such as under 5 years, next to a guardian or caretaker.

Policies as of Jan 2023.

Happy to make updates in response to comments. Hope others find this helpful.

There are several main buckets of policies:

**1. Policy states child is seated with guardian:**

* American Airlines: ""If you’re unable to choose seats, don’t want to pay for seats, or chose a Basic Economy fare, our system will detect that you’re a family traveling. The system will search for seats together automatically before the day of departure. We’ll try our best to keep you together, but if seats are limited, we’ll assign seats so children under 15 are next to at least 1 adult.""

* SAS: ""We always ensure before departure that children sit together with an adult included in the booking"".

* British Airways: ""All children under 12 will be seated with an accompanying adult. Anyone over 12 may be seated separately.""

* Finnair: ""We always make sure that children sit next to one of their parents during the flight. However, we can’t guarantee that the whole family is seated next to each other."" 

* EasyJet: ""Whilst our seating system will always try to seat families together, seats are allocated on a first come first served basis so the earlier you check in the more likely you are to be seated together. If you leave it to the last minute it's possible that there may not be enough seats left for us to seat your family next to each other. We’ll still make sure each child under 12 is seated close to an adult on your booking. However we may only be able to arrange this at the airport or on board, which can cause delays for you and other passengers, and not everyone may be seated together.""

* Ryanair: ""For family bookings, children (aged 2 to 11 years) receive free reserved seating so they can sit beside a parent.""

* Iberia: ""Iberia guarantees that for bookings that include children between the ages of 2 and 12 at least one of the companions will automatically be allocated to the same row of seats as the child, or an adjacent row. This also applies to the companion of a passenger with reduced mobility, provided that this person is identified as such when the booking is made."" (Note: Not sure adjacent rows is good enough for a under 5yo)

**2. Free seat selection for children and accompanying adults, but up to parent to choose adjacent seats, if available**

* Air France: ""If you are traveling as a family with a child (14 years old or younger), we will reserve your seats, free of charge, 2 days before your flight. We will do everything we can to make sure you can travel together and sit next to each other. To make this possible, all of your family members must be included in the same booking file.""

* Cathay Pacific: ""Passengers travelling with a child or an infant can reserve regular seats free of charge.""

* Singapore Airlines: ""All passengers travelling with infants in the same booking may select Forward Zone Seats or Standard Seats in advance for free. Passengers with children in the same booking may select Standard Seats in advance for free"". For children over age 5, you can use their ""unaccommodated minor"" service if you are not seated by your child.

* TAP Air Portugal: ""Automatic and free seat allocation in standard zone for adults and children in same reservation, regardless of the chosen fare. Whenever possible and if there is availability, adult will be allocated to the same row of seats as the child, or an adjacent row.""

**3. Call or ask for adjacent seats and/or ""best effort""**

* Delta: ""Delta strives to seat family members together upon request. If you are unable to obtain seat assignments together for your family using delta.com or the Fly Delta mobile app, please contact Reservations to review available seating options.""

* Alaska: ""Alaska strives to seat family members together upon request. If you are unable to obtain seat assignments together for your family, we will make every effort to seat at least one adult with any young child (age 13 and under) from the same party. Please contact us or check with an airport agent as soon as possible to review available seating options.""

* JetBlue: We will always do our best to seat children with an adult family member.  For the best seating options, we recommend booking early and selecting seat assignments at the time of booking or with a reservation crewmember (third party service fees may apply). If seats together are not available, please let our airport gate crewmembers know when you arrive at the airport. They will do their best to find a seating solution. We cannot guarantee that seats together will always be available.""

* United: ""To make sure your family can sit together, try to book your trip as early as possible and select your seats during booking"" (their policy used to say the opposite ""If only scattered seats are available during booking, you have a better opportunity for children in your family to sit with adult family members by not selecting seats as United’s system will attempt to seat families on the same reservation with unassigned seats together"")

* JAL: ""If you are traveling with small children or escorts but unable to select seats together, please conatact (sp) our Special Assistance Desk."" Also ""Passengers traveling with children between 8 days and 2 years old who select their seats on the JAL website will have a child icon displayed on their seats on the seat selection screen. This lets other passengers know a child may be sitting there.""

**4. Book special ticket or have to pay to sit together**

* Vueling: Appears that you need to book a ""family fare"": ""when you take the whole family you want to be able to sit together on the plane and you probably need to take more luggage"". Note: Does ""wanting to sit together"" mean that you will sit together?

* Royal Air Maroc: Appears one needs to buy a ""Family Pack"". https://www.royalairmaroc.com/int-en/family-pack

* Lufthansa: Unclear. ""we recommend that you reserve your seats in advance when you make your flight booking."" (This appears to have a fee of up to 50eu)

* KLM: ""We always endeavour to seat families together. If it’s not possible we will do our best to make sure each child is seated next to an adult from your group. If you would like to ensure that all members of your family get to sit together, you can reserve your seats for a small fee during the booking process. ""

**5. Totally unclear or ones I couldn't find by searching their sites**

2022-11-28 04:18:38,American Airlines: Seat selection was cleared on one segment of flight and the same seat is now $80,"So I'm flying Domestic by American Airlines tomorrow - small town in Texas to Philly with a stop in DFW. Until yesterday, I had seats selected on both segments (aisle seats that I really wanted, because of a condition that needs me to walk around a bit). When I just checked my flight on the app, it showed that my second segment from DFW to PHL had its assigned seat cleared and the same seat that I'd previously booked is now $80 extra and the only seats available for no charge are middle seats


Has anybody else had this happen to them or is this a freakish occurrence? I have no way to prove that my seat was previously selected because AA doesn't send any email confirmation when I selected a seat and I didn't think to take screenshots when I'd last selected seats. Is there any recourse? Or should I just suck it up and pay the $80, which I'd love to avoid if I could

2024-11-05 21:58:29,"If traveling to the Philippines, avoid Philippine Airlines if you can. ","Philippine Airlines (PAL) is the only airline that flys from the LAX directly to Manila. If flying from LAX, flight time to Manila is 14 hours on average. Other airlines have connections and travel time are 18 hours or more. However, direct is always not best, especially if you are flying Philippine Airlines. They are just the absolute worst. And my experience is not a one-off. This has been a recurring issue for decades that can't be addressed because, well, they are the flag-carrier of the Philippines and there's no competition.  
  
Our family of three booked a flight to Manila from LAX via Philippine Airlines, with paid and reserved seats on both legs. Flight to Manila was smooth, from the booking, check-in process until we left the airport. I was surprised because for years of flying LAX-MNL and back, I have always encountered an issue with Philippine Airlines. Issues ranging from defective seats, entertainment console, tray tables, lost baggages (with valuables, and only the baggage with the valuables gets lost every single time) etc. But this time, it was smooth. I was surprised.  
  
But PAL soon enough showed its true colors. A few days before our return flight, I got an email saying that the aircraft got downgraded from a Boeing to a smaller Airbus. As a result, they are now overbooked and looking for volunteers to be put on a different flight. Because of this, our family lost paid seats. After calling customer service, I also found out that my wife and toddler got put on a different flight and on a different day. They got put on that flight without our approval. Without any consent. 

To put them on the same flight as myself, we had to buy new seats. On top of what we already paid for previously. Ok, what's another $300 on top of our $3000 ticket right?

The night before our flight, I couldn't check-in my wife and toddler. App and website show they are waitlisted and we had to settle the issue on the counter.

Day of the flight, we arrived 4 hours early to check-in. In their system, my wife and toddler does not have a seat. The payment that we made is not reflecting in their system. They were actually in the process of putting my wife and toddler to another flight which is 3 days later. I fought it. I showed the receipt including the credit card transaction of our paid seats. Agent went inside the office and had to ask the manager to override the system. Great, we got in the flight together. We were able to go home.

But imagine if you're an elderly that does not have access to all these tools. Imagine if you are not tech-savy, or it's your first time traveling. Imagine if it's a one-way trip and all your funds are on this flight with no other means. 

As I mentioned, this is not the first time that this happened to me. When I was single and younger, I was traveling to/from LAX-MNL and this happens quite often. I always pay and reserve a window seat but most of the time I get re-assigned and placed in the middle of the middle aisle. I've submitted complaints. I've filed grievances.

2019-04-18 00:12:59,Airline Warning- SouthWest,"So I wanted to share a really terrible travel experience with Southwest in the hopes of warning other travelers to be careful with/stay away from this airline.

My friend and I took a trip to NYC this past week and he booked his flight back to CHI via Southwest. The day of his flight (4/15) we show up to the airport and the airline had revoked his seat on the flight offering no explanation as to why. They chalked it up to a bad credit card even though he had been charged. We found an alt flight with them the following evening and they instructed us to purchase the ticket in person at the airport to guarantee a seat. I purchased his ticket in person on my debit card to make sure this didn't happen again, and we showed up to the airport more than 5 hours early so this wouldn't be an issue. My card was charged and we were issued a boarding pass.  
At 9pm on 4/16 when his flight was boarding, he was not permitted to board the plane at the gate. Not only did they not offer an explanation as to why they would not allow him to board. The staff refused to speak with me, the card holder. I have yet to receive a refund and I am not confident that we will. I spoke with their reps in the customer relations and reservation department and even they refused to give me a reason as to why he was not allowed to board.

I travel a lot for work (at least 2 weeks a month I am on the road) and I have never had an experience as bad as this.

C) find another flight of a competing airline and pay for pricy same-day tickets.

My friend and I are both traveling during the same period next month, and even though we're going to different places (her to Spain, me to Brazil), as luck would have it we're both on the same connecting flight back home from Frankfurt to Shanghai (where we live).

Her whole trip is with Lufthansa, and she booked on their website, so she can choose her seating (though she pays for this).  Since my flight is on multiple airlines, I had to book using another travel website, and didn't/don't have the option to choose my seat.

We're also starting this flight in different places (her in Madrid, me in Sao Paulo), and only meeting up inside the Frankfurt airport, so we can't check in together to ask to be seated together.  Does anybody know how we can be put together on the 11 hour flight from Frankfurt to Shanghai, if we're arriving in Frankfurt on different flights, and will by that point have already been given boarding passes?

2024-05-21 17:34:36,Is it rude to ask to switch seats?,"My family of 3 will be traveling across the US soon. We booked economy seats, not basic economy, so we could choose our seats.

Unfortunately, only middle seats were included in that “choose your own seat” option. The regular economy aisle and window seats available cost an extra $40-$50 because they’re “preferred” seats. 

However, since we’re traveling with a young child and with the backlash of separating families and the push from the department of transportation, US airlines for the most part are sitting 1 parent/guardian with their child. So, we were assigned a “preferred” seat and a middle seat next to each other at no extra charge, which our child and I will be sitting in. The other seat was a middle seat a row over. E.g. We had 22B, 22C, and 22E. We decided to purchase the window seat of that same aisle (22F) because the window of our row, 22A, was taken. I tried moving our seats to an empty row but we would be charged for 2 “preferred seats” since the airline gave us one assigned for free, but we can’t change the location or we’ll be charged. 

I’m hoping we can ask the person in the window seat (22A) if they’d be willing to switch to 22F. Would that be rude? If they say no, that’s fine, I’m just afraid of being berated for not “planning ahead” even though we tried.

I’m already frustrated because we paid hundreds extra for regular economy on a major US airline instead of flying a cheaper airline or choosing basic economy, specifically so we can choose our own seat like they say you can. Just to see that they now have “preferred” aisle and window seating that cost extra. And not $10-$15 but $50 extra!! If their wasn’t such an outrage and pushback to ensure young children sat with at least one guardian it would probably be an extra $100-$150 on top for us to sit together. And this is regular economy, not preferred! It feels like a bait and switch because when booking it doesn’t tell you that only some economy seats will be available to choose from included in the price. It’s not worth it anymore. Getting charged for luggage, carry on bags, food, drinks and now being charged for wanting to sit in the aisle or window. Ok, now I’m venting.

2018-02-19 03:11:42,Does Norwegian Air assign seats prior to check-in?,"Initially I understood that your seat, if not reserved, was assigned when you check in at the airport. However, I was looking at what seats were still available on my flight in two days and it seems every seat has been reserved except for a handful of middle seats in the back. This strikes me, because a week ago when I looked, at least 75% of the seats were available. Given that Norwegian is a budget airline, I would have expected that most people would avoid paying for the extra ""perks."" So, could it be that Norwegian already assigns seats prior to check in? Or are most people paying the ~$45 to reserve a seat, even in the middle? [screenshot for reference](https://imgur.com/a/xIzKp)

*Edit, solved. I just looked up my flight on Expertflyer.com and it had an explanation! It shows which seats are available, occupied, or ""blocked.""

",1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/7yjo9m/does_norwegian_air_assign_seats_prior_to_checkin/,"Does Norwegian Air assign seats prior to check-in? Initially I understood that your seat, if not reserved, was assigned when you check in at the airport. However, I was looking at what seats were still available on my flight in two days and it seems every seat has been reserved except for a handful of middle seats in the back. This strikes me, because a week ago when I looked, at least 75% of the seats were available. Given that Norwegian is a budget airline, I would have expected that most people would avoid paying for the extra ""perks."" So, could it be that Norwegian already assigns seats prior to check in? Or are most people paying the ~$45 to reserve a seat, even in the middle? [screenshot for reference](https://imgur.com/a/xIzKp)

*Edit, solved. I just looked up my flight on Expertflyer.com and it had an explanation! It shows which seats are available, occupied, or ""blocked.""

The flight to ORD I found a decent seat for free, but from ORD-SAN they're either Preferred($31) or Main Cabin Extra ($61). And there are only 7 of them left. The website said if I don't choose a seat now I'll get assigned one at the gate, but considering how many are left I don't want to run the risk of getting bumped.

I don't feel like paying for a seat but I don't want to risk getting bumped. Should I suck it up and pay for a seat or wait till I get to ORD for one?

My parents divorced when I was about 6 years old. My father moved back to California, while my mother and I moved to Kentucky. I knew that a time would come that I would have to leave my mom and fly across the country. As a kid who had never left his mommy before, it was a traumatizing thought. My mother didn't have a lot of money. We lived in a small trailer in the hills of KY. Southwest was the cheapest option for our low income family. Usually when you save money you lose service, but here it was just the opposite.


My mother was distraught and terrified of sending her only little boy alone with a stranger across the US. Post 9/11 and a massive war going on over seas, who wouldn't be. Every time I left she would stay and watch my flight leaves, and she watched until the airplane was out of sight. She would tell me later in life about how she would just lay on the floor crying and praying for my safety. 


Southwest was a miracle though. The night before my flight was scheduled to leave, we recieved a phone call. It was the flight attendant that we would meet the next day. My teary eyed mother passed me the phone, and she spoke spoke to me so kindly about how everything was going to work. She got me excited about being able to fly, and all the amazing things I'd be able to see from so far up! Even the drinks and snacks I'd be able to have. It calmed both of us greatly. It didn't fix that her baby was being taken away, or that I had to leave my mom, but it sure did help. The next day we met the wonderful women, and she stayed with me all the way until I got to LAX. 


I will never forget this. Now in my 20s Southwest Airlines is always my families first option because even though they may not be the cheapest option. They care more than any airline out there. Since then I've been to 8 different countries and have been a all over the US. 


I hope someone sees this. Maybe a mother about to send her baby on their first flight alone. Maybe a person who has never flown before and is too scared. Or maybe someone who flies all the time, but hasn't experienced great customer service.

2024-01-07 07:38:54,Weird Accidental Business class upgrade experience...,"I think I've got first/business class tickets I didn't pay/ask for?

Backstory: I booked a flight a while back, upgraded to economy plus/exit-row type stuff almost right away. I've done this a few times before, and sometimes/often I'll see a ""Upgrade to business/first"" button in the app. I usually take a look and gauge whether I think the price is worth it. This is a special trip and I'm taking an older friend of mine who doesn't fly much and who is a fair bit larger so I wanted to see it if it was a possibility. The price looked good - but it only covered the (notably) shorter leg of the two flights I had to take to get to my destination. So I decided to hold off.

A while later on a very sleepless night I got the idea to call the airline and see if it was possible to upgrade the whole flight to business/first (I'd seen available seats online so I figure they weren't sold out). Spoke to a nice woman for a long time who explained to me through whatever crazy airline logic - it couldn't be upgraded the ticket had to be refunded and replaced - and that she could only do it for the two departure flights since one of the legs on the return was full in business or whatever. Eventually she managed to get the computer to quote me a price difference after refund, and it was in short - a lot. Something I could technically afford but not something I was comfortable with. I thanked her for her time and said I'd think about it - I guess too embarrassed to admit I wasn't as well off as I'd hoped.

The next day I noticed when logging into the app or going online that my flight information was all messed up...it had a bunch of duplicate flights listed - and some didn't have seats assigned, I thought it might be because of the prior conversation with customer service, but I couldn't access the duplicate flights to see if I could change my seat. I figured it was a temporary/hold error and it would correct itself soon. Well after a few weeks it was still the same and I got nervous that I'd lose the premium economy or the entire flight would be messed up...so I called customer service again.

Got a different woman this time, quite nice and helpful, but heavy accent so our communication was less than perfect. She didn't understand what my problem was for a while, but then finally saw it.  She eventually did notice the duplicate tickets and asked about it - I had tried to be vague before, but conceded that I was considering upgrading and admitted that ""no I don't think I paid for the upgrade"" and asked if it was still the same price difference. She said yes, and so I said - ""no I think I'll just stick with my original ticket"" or something to that effect. Anyway she said she thought she fixed it and asked me to log out and back in and see if it looked right. To my surprise I now had the first/business flights for departure - I dashed through it to see if the seats were now selectable, and indeed they were. I do wonder if she knew what she was doing because I swear she said something to the effect of ""does everything look good"" with a little bit of a ""wink wink"" tone, but I really can't be sure. I thanked her profusely (without admitting that I got something I wasn't supposed to have) and left a positive review on their automated service. I've waited around to see if it would go away or a mysterious charge would appear on my credit card, but so far everything still looks magical.

&#x200B;

I don't know what happened? Is this a reward for being decent to customer service people? (I was thanked for my loyalty of being a member of whatever rewards program they have - but it's just a free program and I don't fly that much)  Is it a mistake? You think I'll get to keep it? My only real concern is somehow this mistake could get caught when I'm actually boarding or checking in and I'll lose not only the upgrade but the premium economy I paid for already (or worse) my spot on the flight altogether. On the other hand I""m loathe to call up and be like ""please take away the best thing an airline has ever done for me in my life.""

2015-04-14 19:27:24,"Protrips: Seat assignments, what are your rights when asked to move?","I figured I'd try to introduce a little bit of different topics and discussion on here so here it goes.

At no time are you ever required to give up the seat that you personally picked and/or was assigned to you when you board a plane. The only one who can change this is an FA in which, you may ask ""Are you making this a lawful order or a courtesy."" If a courtesy, you are within your full legal limits of refusing to comply but if it escalates, shut up and just write to the airline after the fact.
There is of course, a matter of courtesy, to which is appreciated by mankind but if you scoured your seat assignments ahead of time and maybe even went as far as paying for an economy comfort/preferred seat then I feel you should know your rights.
It isn't your fault someone booked a flight without knowing how to assign seats together. Your own comfort should not be affected by piss poor planning done by other parties.


If someone asks to swap - VERIFY the seat you are swapping for. They may just not want to sit in the middle and will use your kindness to take advantage of YOU in order to better their comfort.
Last rule of seat confrontations: Do NOT engage with a seat poacher, do not try to get an an argument and don't try to handle it on your own. A simple solution is to utilize the FA who which then can give the lawful order to make the person trying to squat your assigned seat to get the f out of it.

2015-07-23 16:25:39,How does the airline seat assigning works in USA?,"I recently helped my uncle to buy some tickets for traveling to Dubai (we are in Mexico). First I bought him a round trip ticket from Phoenix to NYC, and then from NYC to Dubai (he would reach Phoenix by bus, we are pretty close to the border). 

Now, here in Mexico, you commonly have 2 options: You either pay for a seat when buying your ticket, or buy the ticket and wait until there are about 48 hours left to do a Web check-in and select an empty seat of the ones remaining.

When buying in USA (Delta Airlines) 2 weeks in advance, I had the option to select either premium seats, or no-cost seats. There were a lot of seats that weren't available too (my guess is they have already been selected?). I required to buy 2 seats next to each other for my uncle and aunt, so I selected 2 no-cost ones, and then printed the tickets. They even had the seat numbers (7A and 7B)

Today, my uncle sent me a message saying that in the NYC airport, they had to do another check-in and they had to choose their seats again. Now, obviously the only remaining seats were spread and far from each other and only middle ones, so they had to travel in separate seats for 12 hours. 

I am pretty confused about this, does this happen frequently? Were the seats that I selected when buying not valid? How can I assure that this doesn't happen on the return trip?

Thank you.

EDIT: Sorry about the confusion. The Phoenix-NYC flight went smoothly and the seats that I chose were valid (this was with US Airways). It was in a totally different flight for a different day (NYC-Dubai) were I also chose the seats but they forced another check-in and had to chose new seats, which were not good at all.

If we don't pay extra but are among the first to check in, does that mean we can just sit in whatever seats are available after everyone who has paid is in their seat?

A group of us are heading to Las Vegas on Spirit for a bachelorette next week, and I'm just wondering if anyone's had any luck being seated together WITHOUT paying extra for seat assignments? We are all on the same reservation, but the Spirit site makes it pretty clear they can't guarantee anything.

If we don't pay extra but are among the first to check in, does that mean we can just sit in whatever seats are available after everyone who has paid is in their seat?

2020-10-01 00:00:17,Coronavirus Megathread (Early Oct 2020): For travel-related discussion in the context of COVID-19,"As the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation continues to have a major effect on travel – with many now looking to understand if, when, or how their travels might be feasible – /r/travel is shifting to semi-monthly megathreads until the crisis dissipates.

In the interest of reducing the number of one-off questions, **before you post a question about how to deal with your individual travel plans, consider whether your situation is adequately addressed by the following:**

## Are borders open? What entry or transit restrictions are in place? Will I need to quarantine?

A list of travel restrictions can be found in a number of sources, including from [IATA](https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm) – or [this alternative site](https://covidtravelrestrictions.com/) that draws information from IATA. Note that IATA only deals with travel restrictions by air (so it will not speak to any land border restrictions or closures).

You may also do well to check out government and embassy sources from the destination country (and sometimes from your own embassy in the destination country). **Because information can change on short notice, it is important to verify the latest information, ideally from government sources.**

## ...in the US?

At the time of writing, *foreign nationals* are prohibited from entering or transiting the US if they have been in or transited via Brazil, China, Iran, Ireland, the Schengen Area, or the UK in the preceding 14 days. Exceptions to this rule include green card holders. *Note that (except for, of course, US citizens) this is not a citizenship-based restriction; it is purely based on travel history.* The land borders with Mexico and Canada are closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes, but [air, rail, and sea (but not commuter rail or ferry) ports-of-entry remain open](https://ca.usembassy.gov/travel-restrictions-fact-sheet/) to non-essential travel.

There are no quarantine-on-arrival requirements at the nationwide level, but individual states and/or cities may have their own requirements. You will need to confirm with information from your destination state or city.

For more information, see [the US CDC's COVID-19 page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html).

## ...in Canada?

At the time of writing, *foreign nationals* are barred from entering Canada unless they are traveling for essential reasons, *regardless of mode of travel*. Those traveling from countries other than the US must also fulfill one of several additional categories of exemptions. Those who are permitted to travel to Canada for non-essential purposes include, aside from Canadians, permanent residents. Fully airside international transits are typically permitted.

All international arrivals are required to quarantine for 14 days.

For more information, see [the Canadian government's COVID-19 travel restrictions page](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/travel-restrictions-exemptions.html).

## ...in the UK?

At the time of writing, there are no changes to the UK's standard entry requirements. However, international arrivals that have been in or transited via countries not on the [exemption list](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors) will need to quarantine for 14 days after arrival. The exemption list is subject to change (with countries being added or removed) on short notice.

Note that, even if one is required to quarantine, one is permitted to leave the UK to continue their travels before the 14-day period is complete.

For more information, see [UK Border Control](https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control).

## ...in the EU? In the Schengen Area?

In late June, the European Commission recommended that external borders be reopened to short-term visitors arriving from several countries deemed to have adequately maintained the virus. Those countries were Algeria, Australia, Canada, China (subject to confirmation of reciprocity), Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay. This list, however, was non-binding among member countries and is subject to change.

Nevertheless, several countries within the EU or the Schengen Area have used this list as guidance, permitting arrivals from these countries as well as ""EU+"" countries (which includes EU and Schengen countries as well as the UK). These restrictions typically are not based on nationality but rather travel history and/or residency; consult resources from your destination country. Fully airside non-Schengen to non-Schengen transits are typically permitted, but confirm and consult resources from your transit country to see if further documentation is required.

As the various EU and Schengen countries have opened their external borders to third--country nationals in various ways and with different exceptions, it is imperative that travelers check the entry requirements for their ports-of-entry. A summary of travel restrictions is [provided by the European Union](https://reopen.europa.eu/en), but many have reported that government (e.g. embassy or foreign ministry) resources have been more detailed and accurate.

## ...in South Korea?

At the time of writing, [most nationalities](http://viewer.moj.go.kr/skin/doc.html?rs=/result/bbs/229&fn=temp_1586503947805100) with visa-free or visa-waiver arrangements with Korea have had their visa-free/waiver status suspended, primarily on the basis of the reciprocal entry restrictions for Korean citizens. There are also additional entry and transit restrictions of those traveling from China.

International arrivals, with very few exceptions, will be required to quarantine for 14 days; non-residents will be required to quarantine in government facilities at their own expense.

For more information, see the [Korea Immigration Service](http://www.immigration.go.kr/immigration_eng/index.do).

## ...in Japan?

At the time of writing, foreign nationals who have been in one of 140+ countries for purposes other than transit are not permitted to enter Japan. Further, visas and visa exemptions for nationals from many countries have been suspended. Permanent residents, long-term residents, and spouses and children of Japanese citizens may be exempt from these entry restrictions provided they meet certain conditions.

Those individuals, including Japanese citizens, that are permitted to enter Japan will be required to undergo a 14-day quarantine.

For more information, see the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan](https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html).

## When will borders reopen or travel restrictions be lifted? Is it safe/a good idea to book travel for a particular time months ahead?

It is, of course, impossible to say when travel restrictions are lifted for every country. Where no news has been officially provided, it is often very difficult to predict as countries will make decisions based on the progress of the pandemic – which is an unknown – as well as other pressures (e.g. economic or social).

Consider that the progress of the pandemic and efforts to combat it are unpredictable. Perhaps there will be a vaccine by the time you travel, but perhaps there won't be. Perhaps there will be a resurgence of cases, rendering your travel unwise or impossible, but perhaps there won't be. Perhaps the objective of your trip will be closed, but perhaps it won't be.

Realize that you are taking a risk by deciding to speculatively book travel in the hopes that travel restrictions are lifted. With this unprecedented situation, old adages about when it's best to purchase airfare may no longer be valid. In any event, be aware of the policies of your airlines and accommodations for credits and/or refunds should you need to reschedule or cancel.

Further, understand that airlines may make it very difficult to receive a refund, even if legally required. Many travelers report waiting months to receive refunds on cancelled flights or otherwise being stonewalled when requesting a refund. And be aware that if your airline goes out of business, your funds could be lost forever.

Take note of your jurisdiction's laws regarding refunds for cancelled flights. For example:

* [US Dept of Transportation: Refunds](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds)
* [EU: Air passenger rights](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm)

## So should I cancel a trip that I've already booked? And how? Will insurance help?

2013-12-16 22:45:32,How Spirit airlines ruined our holiday:a trip obituary,"I could give you a whiney rant about how we missed our cruise, and lost the cost of the trip, and we're so disappointed, but I won't. I will tell you about the customer service.  Our plane was delayed and replaced by a smaller one, which they forgot to tell us about until after the initial departure time. We were informed by an AirMiles representative that a Spirit staff member would be with us soon. In Spirit terms, *soon* apparently means two hours. A staffer arrived at last and explained that any lowlifes who had cheaped out and not paid $10 for assigned seats (but who cares about those anyway? You sleep on planes) had to go down to rebooking to be put on a different flight. She promised meal vouchers and $50 future credit for the delay. 

So back through security and down to rebooking we go. Our first clue should have been that Spirit was the only baggage/rebooking office to have its own queue.  Our second was that it was already full of weary folks who had been in line since 4 that morning.  Assuming we could get on other airlines' flights as promised, the couple dozen hopefuls whipped out their phones and laptops to find alternatives. There were a couple of options for other flights, but two hours on the hotline later we found nobody with the power to make that switch.  An unsuccessful rebooking candidate who got a new flight and one nights hotel but has to fork out dough for two other nights and a connecting flight to Colombia reports that another staff member has been called into work. This staffer never showed, but I don't blame him for avoiding customer service hell. 

As the delayed flight's departure time neared, I ran back up to check-in and asked for some clarification. She couldn't tell me why those with assigned seats got to stay and we had to go, whether or not there were any seats left on the flight, if she could put us on standby, or whether buying assigned seats in hind-sight would get us anywhere. She really couldn't tell me anything but to go back to rebooking, where the line was still frozen as it had been for the last two hours. 

I went back up to see about getting our checked bags off the plane while another of my new queue buddies went to chat with the gate attendant about possible stand-by seats. After an hour in security she reports back that the lucky seat-reservers bit her head off for calling on the attendant with a legitimate question while she was still busy filling out their $7 meal vouchers by hand. There were no stand-bys to be had. 

The plane now gone and the cruise ship departure time nearing, the line grew and we tried to remain hopeful. If they'd had more than one guy in the office who was diligently double-fisting the work phone and his own personal cell, we probably could have pooled and found availabilities for all, but alas we inched along at approximately a half hour per family. 

Still no food vouchers for us rejects, but we couldn't get back through security without another hour wait to reach the concessions on the concourse anyway. 

Seven hours after we arrived at the airport and at least four since we got in line, a poor Spirit peon is sent along to tell us everything we already knew, and that a manager would be around soon, or we could call tthe useless-as-fuck hotline. Remember the duration of the Spirit soon.  

Coming on the eighth hour and moving from a state of denial into anger, we finally meet another Spirit employee who is not a manager at all, but a baggage clerk who wants to connect us with our things, which have now reached balmy Florida. 

We are sent with half of our new pals back up to check in, where the attendants don't know what is going on or what they have to do and fled to hide out in the back room once we found baggage lady again to explain the situation. 

Some more endless time staring at the ceiling later, and we're finally issued a refund for our flight, our baggage charge, and our parking. Supposedly our suitcase will find its way to our doorstep tomorrow, but that seems highly dubious. 

8 hours of negligence,
No flight. 
No cruise, and no money back on that. 
No luggage. 
No apology.
No food voucher. 
No $50 credit,
... But we would have torn it up in their faces anyway. 

Exhausted and thoroughly disappointed, we made the trek home. 

Dear luggage, if you're still out there, do enjoy your holiday and come back safe! We miss our toothbrushes already. 

TL;DR Spirit Airlines' shoddy customer service wasted my trip money AND THEY COULDN'T GIVE A DAMN.

Our second was that it was already full of weary folks who had been in line since 4 that morning.  Assuming we could get on other airlines' flights as promised, the couple dozen hopefuls whipped out their phones and laptops to find alternatives. There were a couple of options for other flights, but two hours on the hotline later we found nobody with the power to make that switch.  An unsuccessful rebooking candidate who got a new flight and one nights hotel but has to fork out dough for two other nights and a connecting flight to Colombia reports that another staff member has been called into work. This staffer never showed, but I don't blame him for avoiding customer service hell. 

As the delayed flight's departure time neared, I ran back up to check-in and asked for some clarification. She couldn't tell me why those with assigned seats got to stay and we had to go, whether or not there were any seats left on the flight, if she could put us on standby, or whether buying assigned seats in hind-sight would get us anywhere. She really couldn't tell me anything but to go back to rebooking, where the line was still frozen as it had been for the last two hours. 

I went back up to see about getting our checked bags off the plane while another of my new queue buddies went to chat with the gate attendant about possible stand-by seats. After an hour in security she reports back that the lucky seat-reservers bit her head off for calling on the attendant with a legitimate question while she was still busy filling out their $7 meal vouchers by hand. There were no stand-bys to be had. 

The plane now gone and the cruise ship departure time nearing, the line grew and we tried to remain hopeful. If they'd had more than one guy in the office who was diligently double-fisting the work phone and his own personal cell, we probably could have pooled and found availabilities for all, but alas we inched along at approximately a half hour per family. 

Still no food vouchers for us rejects, but we couldn't get back through security without another hour wait to reach the concessions on the concourse anyway. 

Seven hours after we arrived at the airport and at least four since we got in line, a poor Spirit peon is sent along to tell us everything we already knew, and that a manager would be around soon, or we could call tthe useless-as-fuck hotline. Remember the duration of the Spirit soon.  

Coming on the eighth hour and moving from a state of denial into anger, we finally meet another Spirit employee who is not a manager at all, but a baggage clerk who wants to connect us with our things, which have now reached balmy Florida. 

We are sent with half of our new pals back up to check in, where the attendants don't know what is going on or what they have to do and fled to hide out in the back room once we found baggage lady again to explain the situation. 

Some more endless time staring at the ceiling later, and we're finally issued a refund for our flight, our baggage charge, and our parking. Supposedly our suitcase will find its way to our doorstep tomorrow, but that seems highly dubious. 

8 hours of negligence,
No flight. 
No cruise, and no money back on that. 
No luggage. 
No apology.
No food voucher. 
No $50 credit,
... But we would have torn it up in their faces anyway. 

Exhausted and thoroughly disappointed, we made the trek home. 

Dear luggage, if you're still out there, do enjoy your holiday and come back safe! We miss our toothbrushes already. 

TL;DR Spirit Airlines' shoddy customer service wasted my trip money AND THEY COULDN'T GIVE A DAMN. "

2024-12-01 22:43:34,Oh .. to be in a controversial world where airplanes had no overhead bins!,"Roll-on suitcases are a major pain point in air travel. Boarding and deplaning take forever because everyone is wrestling with them—trying to cram them into the overhead bins or struggling to pull them out, especially since the bins can be hard for many people to reach. What if we got rid of roll-on suitcases altogether for bags that don’t absolutely need to be accessed during the flight? This would only work if airlines had a system where your bag was immediately handed to you as you stepped off the plane, with no delays.

Without roll-ons, we could even get rid of overhead bins entirely, creating more headspace and making the cabin feel much less cramped. Plus, there’d be no incentive to rush onto the plane early since you wouldn’t have to fight for bin space—especially if you already have an assigned seat. It could make air travel faster, easier, and way more comfortable.

2024-10-14 22:44:42,Experience flying Xiamen Airlines (LAX-XMN-HKG),"Flew Xiamen Air from LAX to Hong Kong with a transfer in Xiamen. Overall I would put this airline in the same category as Southwest.

# Check In Process

Could not get the check in page online to work ahead of time. Counter was open about 3-4 hours before departure and able to check-in in person without issue.

# Carry-On Bags

Every communication or website page will say you are limited to 1 piece of carry-on luggage only. They repeated this policy even when asked about  personal item on their customer service line and also via support email. My wife and I both had no problem bringing 1 carry-on suitcase and 1 ""personal item"" (backpacks) to fit under the seat.

Our carry-on luggage was not weighed but we did see some other people in line getting weighed -- might depend on the check-in agent.

# Boarding

There were no formal boarding zones and passengers started lining up \~30 min before boarding time and just boarded in order from the line.

Seats: Economy class seats were relatively ""hard"" but okay for the journey. I am 5'6"", 160 lbs and sat relatively comfortably the whole flight. Business class section seems on par with what you'd expect from other airlines (at least visually from what I could see!)

# Service

English is so-so but attendants were very kind, and genuinely hospitable, even to those that don't speak Chinese. After initial meal service they came around asking anyone if they wanted second servings.

On the international leg (LAX to Xiamen) We had 1 meal after takeoff, 2 snack handouts (nuts and then sandwich) and 2nd meal before landing.

On the short leg of my flight (Xiamen-Hong Kong) they managed to squeeze in snack handouts before takeoff.

# Entertainment

Had a selection of some western, Chinese, and other ""foreign"" films in the seatback entertainment. Not all the displayed films played though. TV shows were mostly all Chinese shows.

# Xiamen Transfer Process

The wording was a bit misleading. We had a layover that was only a few hours so did not follow the ""transfer process"" they share online and in-flight before landing. We also did not have any checked bags.

The ""transfer process"" they share out seems to be for those that want to take advantage of the 144 hour visa and/or a hotel stay as part of the layover. It would have you exiting out of airside, going to another floor of the airport and then get processed at a transfer desk. I think there is  general lounge for all passengers outside the quarantine area based on reviews. I did not follow this process so can't speak to it.

Instead, we followed a ""24 hour transit"" process. Immediately on exiting the plane, you are directed down a separate hall (still airside) with ""24 hour direct transit"" area signage. You will have your boarding pass inspected with your passport at a smaller area and pass through another security check. This is all airside and separate from the main area. This second security check appears to confiscate a lot of lighters. They also took special interest in our power bank but ultimately let it through.

2019-12-08 12:24:05,Review of UTO Vacation's $299 China Tour,"&#x200B;

I recently returned from my trip to China that I booked through UTO about a year ago for $299. I had been reluctant to book it since there was limited information available and it seemed too good to be true. Having now gone on the trip, I thought I would provide as much info as I could to those who are considering it as the deal is still available. 

This is an attempt to review my experience with UTO in particular rather than China itself though I am sure I will struggle to differentiate the two. 

Booking: Booking was very easy. UTO was always responsive when we called and had questions. A couple things about the price: Yes, it really was $299 but also, no, it was not really $299. Only certain dates were available at that price but we were able to book one with no issue and other people on our tour said they booked our date months after we did. There is also a required $180 gratuity that you pay in advance. You are also required to get a Chinese visa. You are able to do this on your own or have UTO arrange this for you for $230. We had UTO do this for us for convenience and simplicity. We had to mail our physical passports in which was stressful but necessary to complete the visa application. Our passports came back in about two weeks with no issue. 

So, at base price, with the visa application, we started at $709. This included our flights to/from China, within China, our hotels, breakfast at the hotel each day, and the actual base tour itself. I was skeptical it was real up until we got our boarding passes to get onto the plane but we had boarding passes waiting for us when we checked in. 

Also note that despite booking a year out, we did not get our official itinerary with our flight info and everything until about a month before (which they note is part of their process) and while that was stressful, it was a smooth process. 

Flight: We flew China Eastern. I read some reviews prior to flying with them that made them sound terrible. I thought they were fine. A 15-hour flight is rough regardless of what plane you’re on. I found the flight attendants to be polite and helpful. The seats were on par with other airlines. The food was terrible but they did provide 2 meals and a snack (I think). We flew NY to Shanghai and immediately boarded another flight to Beijing. Our tour guide was waiting when we arrived. 

Hotels: The hotels were incredible. I thought maybe the catch would be that the we would be in China’s version of a Motel 6 but this was not the case at all. The hotels were over the top, gorgeous, CLEAN, and comfortable. One thing to note is that smoking is extremely prevalent in China and it is widely accepted to smoke indoors including in many hotels and restaurants. One of the rooms we were assigned to reeked of cigarettes. We were switched no problem. 

There is a catch with the hotels though and that is that they are very far from the city center. There was speculation in our tour group that this is done intentionally to make wandering off on your own and not participating in the optional tours more challenging. 

Our hotel in Beijing was pretty isolated though some people did take cabs to/from there. You can always have the hotel call you a taxi though some people said taxis were not thrilled about taking them back to the hotel from the city center due to the distance. 

Wuxi’s hotel is in a metropolitan area but the biggest thing around was a shopping mall. Suzhou and Hangzhou’s hotels were very isolated. 

Shanghai’s hotel was also about 90 minutes from the city center. However, there is a metro stop about a five-minute walk away that can take you directly into the city. Some from our tour utilized this option and said it was easy to navigate (and I’m sure much cheaper than a taxi or guided tour) but was, as expected, very crowded throughout the whole day, even outside of rush hour. 

Tour: There are some base tours included in the package, including going to The Great Wall and walking around certain districts and gardens. Many of the included activities are required sales pitches (more on that later). There are then optional tours you can pick and choose from that cost extra. We did all but one of the optional tours but I included info based on what others in the tour group said about the optional ones. 

Day 1/2: Beijing  -- Travel days – we arrived pretty late and just went straight to the hotel. 

Day 3: Beijing – No required activities for today, only optional tours. Summer Palace/Olympic Park ($55) and Tiananmen Square/Forbidden City ($75). I believe these were the most expensive optional tours. What they don’t tell you about this day is that if you do one of these, you basically have to do both because the bus does not go back to the hotel or drop you off anywhere if you only do one. I will say, I was very happy we did this tour. You should know that the price for this one is a big rip off because entrance fees into these places is much cheaper. However, I do not think we would have been able to effectively see all of these places since they are so spread out and would not have gotten the info the tour guide provided (even if the info was maybe…skewed). The meal we were provided for lunch at a local woman’s home was also the best meal we had our whole trip. 

I am not someone who has done tour groups for full trips in the past and usually like to venture off on my own but was a big fan of this tour. 

Day 4: Beijing – Great Wall Day! You get about two hours there to walk up it, take photos, etc. We went to the Juyongguan part. Wear good shoes. I would say two hours was sufficient there. 

This is also when you attend your first sales pitch. After the Great Wall you go to a Jade store and then the “Chinese Herbal Institute.” The good thing about the herbal institute is that you get a “free” foot massage (you are expected to tip $3-$4) while they tell you you’re dying and need expensive herbal medicine they can prescribe. Somehow, we were all in need of this medicine. Hm. 

Optional tour for the Golden Mask Dynasty Show ($45). Mixed reviews from the group. The show is apparently being performed at the 2022 Winter Olympics. Stage was the most impressive part. Some people felt the performers looked “bored” after having performed the show probably 8 times that day already. 

Day 5: Suzhou

Early flight to Shanghai and then about a 2-hour bus ride to Suzhou. Our flight was delayed which pushed our visit to Lanli Gardens and Garden of the Master of the Nets to the next day. 

Optional Tour for Boat Ride on the Grand Canal and walk around local market ($30). This was my least favorite tour. The boat was covered, it was rainy, and we only got 30 minutes to walk around the market. However, the alternative to the boat ride was to stay on the bus as there was literally nowhere to walk around and the bus was going to meet those who went on the tour in a different spot. For the sake of doing SOMETHING it was worth it. 

Day 6: Suzhou/Wuxi

Because our flight got delayed and things were pushed, this was a rough day. We first went to the “Silk Spinning Factory.” This was by far our longest sales pitch. We were there for about three hours and while you can wander around the store (because let’s be real, that’s what it is) there is nowhere else to wander off to. We then went to Lanli Gardens which I had been excited about but ended up being another sales pitch. This was arguably the most interesting because it was for embroidery and they were beautiful. This one was also much shorter, probably about an hour. But having the two packed into one day was rough. Garden of the Master of the Nets was pretty to walk around. 

We drove about 2 hours to Wuxi and got to walk around Nanchang Street which is a large pedestrian shopping area which was nice but more stores rather than street vendors so not much haggling here. Also only had an hour here. 

Day 7: Wuxi/Hangzhou

You get to walk around Lake Tai which is very pretty. Then, another sales pitch for pearls. They are pretty but they are essentially costume pieces, not worth much. Wuxi is nice, known for their spare ribs. There is a very large shopping mall across the street from the hotel. It was nice to be able to walk around somewhere. 

Drive about four hours to Hangzhou. Hangzhou is GORGEOUS. The optional tour here is a boat ride on the West Lake ($30). You can’t go wrong with this one. The boat ride was amazing but walking around the park if you did not opt for the tour was also amazing. 

Day 8: Hangzhou/Shanghai

Last sales pitch here (yay!) for tea and tea pills. This was nice because it was probably the shortest sales pitch since there is no showroom they make you go look around and the setting is beautiful. 

Drive four hours to Shanghai. Stop at the Bund to walk around. 

Optional Tour is a River Cruise ($45). You get to see the skyline all lit up at night. It was very cool and we definitely got to see more of the skyline if we had just been walking but this was a sort of take it or leave it tour to me. Glad we did it but not the end of the world if you skip this one. Shanghai is very lively and there are lots of things to go see, you would just be limited for time as you’d have to be back to meet the rest of the group the get on the bus. 

Day 9: Shanghai

Free day or optional tours here. First: Maglev train (fastest train in the world?), knock off market, and French quarter. ($45) If you’re into trains or fast things the train is cool, I guess. Not my thing but lots of other people liked it. You don’t take it anywhere, you just take it on it’s one route and then back so I guess you get to ride it twice. The knock off market is where you should buy all of the things you wanted but did not get at the sales pitches it you do not care about things being “real.” I bought the exact scarf for $10 that other people got at the silk factory for $80. You have two hours there. We strongly considered just taking the subway there on our own and saving the $45. Also haggle everything and if you don’t want to pay more just start to walk away – 9/10 times they will give it to you for what you were asking. And if not, there are a thousand other vendors or you hit your limit. 

If you don’t care about the train I would just do that. The train is also cheap to ride but not very accessible on your own. The “French quarter” was an overpriced, westernized, pedestrian market with mostly western food. 

Second optional tour is an acrobat show ($45). I am not super into shows but it was incredible. Great way to end the trip especially because the alternative was to go back to the hotel. Highly recommend. 

Day 10: Early flight home. 

Sales Pitches: We assumed having booked the trip so cheaply there would be a time-share type element to it. There is a sales pitch about once a day. Some are more interesting than others. They definitely give you the hard sell and the tour guides either get a cut of it or have some kind of stake in it because they strongly encourage it, too. The whole tour has an element of sales to it whether it’s at the factories or for the optional tours. I would highly advise against buying any of the herbal medicines purely because you do not really know what is in them. For the rest (jade, pearl, tea, silk, and embroidery) I would suggest just holding out until the knock-off market. 

Also, you’re there as long as your group is shopping so if you get stuck with a group that is super into it even if you’re not, you’ll be there longer. 

All of the stores are government owned and the tour company is government owned. Personally, I would rather have my money go directly to people in the markets. Better for them, because they get it directly, and better for me because it’s way cheaper. We also think the hotels are government owned or have some kind of agreement with the government. Our tour guides were very into the government and talking about how great they are. 

Many felt the tour guides provided really interesting and valuable information. While I loved our tour guides, I would advise you take everything they say with a grain of salt. There are blatant and extreme biases and viewpoints that I am not sure even they are aware of and therefore I was not always confident that the information they were providing was the most accurate. One tour guide told someone the hotel could not call a cab for them and tried to sell them a guided tour – the front desk did call a cab for them when asked, no problem. Part of it is the sales piece, which I understand, but I also wonder how much of the less flattering side of China’s history they are aware of. 

TL;DR: If this is your first trip to China, I would absolutely recommend it. It is not a scam in that you really will go to China, you will stay in actual hotels, and be able to see the country. You do have to sit through numerous sales pitches. If you are someone who cannot say no or give in to high pressure sales tactics, you will end up spending a lot of money. If you can stand up to that, it really is an amazing deal.

Let me know if you have any questions!",150,99,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/e7t53e/review_of_uto_vacations_299_china_tour/,"Review of UTO Vacation's $299 China Tour &#x200B;

I recently returned from my trip to China that I booked through UTO about a year ago for $299. I had been reluctant to book it since there was limited information available and it seemed too good to be true. Having now gone on the trip, I thought I would provide as much info as I could to those who are considering it as the deal is still available. 

This is an attempt to review my experience with UTO in particular rather than China itself though I am sure I will struggle to differentiate the two. 

Booking: Booking was very easy. UTO was always responsive when we called and had questions. A couple things about the price: Yes, it really was $299 but also, no, it was not really $299. Only certain dates were available at that price but we were able to book one with no issue and other people on our tour said they booked our date months after we did. There is also a required $180 gratuity that you pay in advance. You are also required to get a Chinese visa. You are able to do this on your own or have UTO arrange this for you for $230. We had UTO do this for us for convenience and simplicity. We had to mail our physical passports in which was stressful but necessary to complete the visa application. Our passports came back in about two weeks with no issue. 

So, at base price, with the visa application, we started at $709. This included our flights to/from China, within China, our hotels, breakfast at the hotel each day, and the actual base tour itself. I was skeptical it was real up until we got our boarding passes to get onto the plane but we had boarding passes waiting for us when we checked in. 

Also note that despite booking a year out, we did not get our official itinerary with our flight info and everything until about a month before (which they note is part of their process) and while that was stressful, it was a smooth process. 

Flight: We flew China Eastern. I read some reviews prior to flying with them that made them sound terrible. I thought they were fine. A 15-hour flight is rough regardless of what plane you’re on. I found the flight attendants to be polite and helpful. The seats were on par with other airlines. The food was terrible but they did provide 2 meals and a snack (I think). We flew NY to Shanghai and immediately boarded another flight to Beijing. Our tour guide was waiting when we arrived. 

Hotels: The hotels were incredible. I thought maybe the catch would be that the we would be in China’s version of a Motel 6 but this was not the case at all. The hotels were over the top, gorgeous, CLEAN, and comfortable. One thing to note is that smoking is extremely prevalent in China and it is widely accepted to smoke indoors including in many hotels and restaurants. One of the rooms we were assigned to reeked of cigarettes. We were switched no problem. 

There is a catch with the hotels though and that is that they are very far from the city center. There was speculation in our tour group that this is done intentionally to make wandering off on your own and not participating in the optional tours more challenging. 

Our hotel in Beijing was pretty isolated though some people did take cabs to/from there. You can always have the hotel call you a taxi though some people said taxis were not thrilled about taking them back to the hotel from the city center due to the distance. 

Wuxi’s hotel is in a metropolitan area but the biggest thing around was a shopping mall. Suzhou and Hangzhou’s hotels were very isolated. 

Shanghai’s hotel was also about 90 minutes from the city center. However, there is a metro stop about a five-minute walk away that can take you directly into the city. Some from our tour utilized this option and said it was easy to navigate (and I’m sure much cheaper than a taxi or guided tour) but was, as expected, very crowded throughout the whole day, even outside of rush hour. 

Tour: There are some base tours included in the package, including going to The Great Wall and walking around certain districts and gardens. Many of the included activities are required sales pitches (more on that later). There are then optional tours you can pick and choose from that cost extra. We did all but one of the optional tours but I included info based on what others in the tour group said about the optional ones. 

Day 1/2: Beijing  -- Travel days – we arrived pretty late and just went straight to the hotel. 

Day 3: Beijing – No required activities for today, only optional tours. Summer Palace/Olympic Park ($55) and Tiananmen Square/Forbidden City ($75). I believe these were the most expensive optional tours. What they don’t tell you about this day is that if you do one of these, you basically have to do both because the bus does not go back to the hotel or drop you off anywhere if you only do one. I will say, I was very happy we did this tour. You should know that the price for this one is a big rip off because entrance fees into these places is much cheaper. However, I do not think we would have been able to effectively see all of these places since they are so spread out and would not have gotten the info the tour guide provided (even if the info was maybe…skewed).

Somehow, we were all in need of this medicine. Hm. 

Optional tour for the Golden Mask Dynasty Show ($45). Mixed reviews from the group. The show is apparently being performed at the 2022 Winter Olympics. Stage was the most impressive part.

5. I will be filing **EU261** for  600 euro per pax fee for cancelation... and Europe train cancelation fee, and Hotel Stay they missed due to delay and arrival time. 



Mechanical issues can happen.  and Iberia/Level is not known for robust website.  so people in the past had issue with the website.   

  
My parents enjoyed Premium Economy Seat and service. and arrived without issue. 

1. With level, understand their call center hours and system is not as good.

2. call center in open hours was no line.

3. If you are unable to check in.... using web, you can lose your seat, if you get to airport late, and the section is oversold. 

4. Understand Light Class does not include food. "
2024-09-23 14:41:17,Capital One Venture X “Lost” My Flight Seat and Never Informed Me or Refund Me — Has anyone experienced this?,"Hello, this is my first time posting on Reddit — I really don’t know if anything can be done at this point but would love to hear others’ insights and perspectives on this. 

I purchased tickets to Hawaii back in mid-December 2023 for my spouse and I to travel in October 2024. I did this through Capital One Venture X travel portal so (1) I could gain points for the flight and (2) I could use my annual $300 travel credit on one of our tickets. I have emails from Capital One showing confirmation of our purchases of our flight plus confirmation of us paying $255 extra for each our comfort plus seats in the very front row of the main cabin for Hawaiian Airlines. I also received email confirmation/confirmed itinerary from Hawaiian Airlines showing the same information. I went on their website and double checked our flight and seat information the next day, and all looked good, so I moved on to planning the rest of the trip and didn’t think I needed to recheck our flight seats and everything again. 

Now, September, a month before the trip, to be safe, I went through our itinerary to make sure all the logistics were good to go. I thought it was so strange on Hawaiian Airlines, my spouse’s seat shows “11J” and mine (which originally said “11H”) was blank and showed no seat whatsoever and said I can pay to upgrade. I compared this to Capital One Travel, which says I already paid for my flight and seat and have my seat set for 11H. I called Capital One travel to ask what happened and if this was a mistake, because including the travel credit, I paid ~$655 per person for both the flight itself and each of our assigned seat. I was on the phone with them for two hours then one hour with Hawaiian Airlines through this whole fiasco. Turns out, two to three days after I purchased the tickets for everything back in December, for some unclear reason they could not provide, payment from Capital One Travel did not go through for JUST my seat. Only payment for both of our base flight and my spouse’s seat went through. 

What blew my mind was I never got any refund for the past 10 months, nor got any notification of my seat getting canceled from neither capital one nor Haiwaiian airlines. I understand capital one is a third party that mediated my flight plans, so I was so upset that they kept my $655 and didn’t inform me of the cancelation of the seat and they didn’t even initiate the refund back to me, as Hawaiian Airlines told me they only received the base $400 part for my flight itself, and was just waiting for the $255 payment from capital one for the seat I requested for. So even if their email and website did originally showed I got the 11H seat on their itinerary back in December, they removed it later due to lack of payment. I asked how come I never got an email from either of them about my lost seat since they both emailed me about my itinerary, so they had my contact information, and all they did was apologize. Capital one also was not sure why the seat didn’t go through and why I never got a refund and no one could do anything to compensate or make up for the lost seat I originally purchased ~10 months ago. (Someone else now occupies seat 11H.) 

Seat prices went up so I ended up having to purchase another comfort plus seat located in the middle-back for the same cost of $255. I argued that my spouse should stick with the original 11J front seat since it is nice to be up there, but my spouse and I agreed to stick together so my spouse’s seat got moved back to be next to mine — due to this, we technically “lost $60” since the original 11J seat is $60 more than our current seat in row 21 but did not get any refund for this change of seat either.

2024-05-31 07:15:21,Same airline transfer - no boarding pass,"Hi all,

I am flying with Egyptair from Sharm el Sheikh resorts area to Newark, NJ. I have a 7 hours layover in Cairo. When I checked in online this morning, I got a boarding pass for my first leg from SSH to Cairo, but no boarding pass for my flight from Cairo to EWR. It said “receive your boarding pass at the check in counter”. I was able to complete online checkin for both flights and I have a seat assigned and baggage checked in for my both legs. Everything was purchased on the same ticket with the same airline (Egyptian Air). 

My question is, am I supposed to exit the airport in Cairo and then reenter to obtain my pass and go through all security shenanigans? It’s an overnight layover from 23:45 to 7:00, I was hoping to just crawl in some quiet corner in the Terminal 3 and sleep for five-six hours before my 12 hours flight to America. If I need to exit the airport, then what? Registration doesn’t open till 4 am, am I supposed to sit on the street all night long? 

Egypt air doesn’t provide any instructions and there is no online chat with an agent. 

Thank you all for your help!

2023-12-27 14:16:49,Nightmare travel experience flying French Bee MIA>ORY,"Attempted to fly French Bee, and had one of the (if not the) worst airline experiences I’ve ever had.
 
Booked a trip back in September, MIA>ORY on French Bee. Checked flight earlier this week and booked special meals - all was good. Arrived at airport and front desk couldn’t find our reservation in their system. On investigation it turned out our tickets were “suspended” due to overbooking; the agent said we should have received an email, and that we were likely rebooked with another carrier. There was never any notice provided prior to this, and turns out we were never rebooked. 

After waiting for nearly two hours (literally every other passenger checked in and went to the gate), the agent says she found two seats for us, we could proceed to the gate, which we did. 

Flight was delayed so stayed at gate for nearly two hours, until boarding time. Finally, as we attempted to board, our newly printed tickets wouldn’t scan, we were told to wait for a few moments, and were subsequently told that our new seats were being given to mechanics who preferred not to sit in their assigned seats (which were “serviceable to flight staff but not to regular passengers”). Pilot came out, offered no apology and told us the decision is final. 

Six hours spent at the airport, two bumping incidents, now stuck in Miami. No compensation offered at airport (per DOT they should have paid us at the airport when this occurred). I’m out several thousand $s from flight costs, accommodations, tours booked.  I’m sure I’ll get some reimbursement per DOT and EU guidelines but this is a huge bummer and would NEVER fly with this airline again.",115,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18s1ofs/nightmare_travel_experience_flying_french_bee/,"Nightmare travel experience flying French Bee MIA>ORY Attempted to fly French Bee, and had one of the (if not the) worst airline experiences I’ve ever had.

In spite of getting a confirmation on the screen, the seats disappeared from my booking a day later.  I'm guessing this wouldn't happen if you actually upgraded to expensive seats, but for cheapskates we just get assigned seats at check-in.  My wife and I got seated together, so all is good, but the process is definitely unclear.  Upon check-in, you have the option to change seat selection, but there were only a handful of open seats (mostly singles).

Update: I decided to go ahead and reserve the cheapest option at $40/seat/segment.  Went through selection on both ways, but seemingly never had to pay anything.  Booking from the US, I go through [Swiss.com](http://Swiss.com), not Edelweiss.  Every step along the way, it clearly indicates there is a fee, but then poof, the selected seats show up on the booking summary, total price hasn't changed, and I didn't have to run my card again.

 I'm hoping to glean some wisdom from the community regarding a recent experience with AirAsia. While I understand it's not the most pressing issue out there, I'm feeling a bit lost and would appreciate some guidance.  
On **December 3rd**, I flew from **Cebu to Seoul** on **Flight Z2 9048,** both my wife and I encountered discomfort due to our assigned seats being completely unable to recline during the 4.5 hour journey trip. This was particularly challenging for me as I have a pre-existing back condition.

Adding to the inconvenience, the in-flight entertainment tablet assigned to me also malfunctioned and was unusable throughout the journey. We informed a flight attendant about these issues during the flight and followed their recommendation by submitting a detailed complaint with supporting documentation afterwards.

Despite submitting a complaint two months ago and receiving an ""escalation"" email (apologizing for the delay) over a month ago, we have yet to receive any additional updates or a resolution from AirAsia.  


**My questions:**

1. Considering the lack of response and impact on our comfort (especially my back condition), do you think it's reasonable to reach out to AirAsia again?
2. Are there any recommended steps I can take to pursue some form of acknowledgement or gesture of goodwill, considering both the non-reclining seats and the damaged tablet?
3. Has anyone else faced similar situations with AirAsia? If so, what advice can you offer on how you approached it?

2023-11-16 02:49:12,Norse Antlantic Airways Review,"I flew with Norse very recently, a relatively new ""budget"" airline that does international flights. I flew from Miami to London (Gatwick), then London to NYC (JFK). About 8 hours each.

I wanted to write this review because I didn't find much before flying with them and felt like I was taking a risk with a cheap airline for a long international flight.

Overall a pretty good experience! They market themselves more as a ""pay for what you want"" airline rather than a ""budget"" airline, which in my opinion works.

BAGGAGE: The thing where they can get you price wise is baggage. It's a lot cheaper to book your baggage while booking the flight online than after or at the airport. DON'T BUY THE CHECKED BAG AT THE AIRPORT. Buy it as you book, it's a lot cheaper. And if you're overweight there's a substantial upcharge. I watched in line an old lady have to pay $200+ for a checked bag she didn't buy online and was overweight. If you book luggage then change your mind, you will not get a refund on baggage according to their policy.

They also will size check a carry-on. My backpack did not get size checked, and I threw it in the overhead bins.
They flag carry-ons, they give you a tag that says ""Norse approved overhead carry-on"" or ""underseat"". When I put my ""underseat"" backpack overhead I got no push back from flight attendants, but my flights were only medium filled and had plenty of room.

*Also, there are 2 types of checked bags at different weights. Make sure you pick the appropriate one. One of them is listed at 35lbs and the other 50lbs. My friend accidentally choose the 35lbs then had to pay extra when it came to checking the bag.

FLIGHT: A good flight experience. The boarding was smooth, the flight attendants are nice, presentable, and professional. The planes aren't ""cheap"" like Spirit where the seats are uncomfortable. The seats were comfy, padded, with enough leg room (I'm 6'3), I believe the plane was a 737 Dreamliner. A 3-3-3 seat row setup. Plenty of free movie options although they do not provide headphones. I can't remember if you can buy some, I'm sure you can.

EXTRA FEES: You have to pay to pick your seat, but in both my flights it wasn't very packed and was able to quickly move to the window/aisle from my assigned seat. 
A meal is not included but you can buy one for around $10. Not a great hot meal tbh but still food. Sodas were $3. Again they do ""pay for what you want"".  But the things you can pay for don't seem out of this world expensive.
I just brought a sandwich from the airport, snack and plenty of water onboard and didn't have a problem.
They also sell random stuff during the flight. Duty free things like colognes or just some random shit. They have a catalog and walk down the aisle once during the flight selling duty free stuff. It was pretty random but they don't shove it down your throat or anything, just did one polite pass during the flight.

SUPPORT: Their customer support is thin. There is no phone line. Just email. I accidentally booked a carry-on and tried to get it refunded. Sent an email, got a response in a day or two, stating they don't issue refunds for booked luggage as per their policy.

Not important but, a very nice aesthetic. I liked their uniforms and color scheme. They have this northern lights, navy blue and pale blue color scheme going on that looks great.

Overall a very good option that I would definitely fly again given the price point compared to more expensive airlines.

TLDR: Norse is an International Low-Cost Airline. Good experience, didn't feel cheap, good movies, can pay for all the extras, seat, meal etc if you want them. Baggage can be expensive if you don't book online. No refunds for some things and no phone customer support to call, just email. Nice color scheme.

I flew from Miami to London (Gatwick), then London to NYC (JFK). About 8 hours each.

I wanted to write this review because I didn't find much before flying with them and felt like I was taking a risk with a cheap airline for a long international flight.

Overall a pretty good experience! They market themselves more as a ""pay for what you want"" airline rather than a ""budget"" airline, which in my opinion works.

2024-05-20 22:48:30,Connection missed!,"Hello all!! 

 Would really appreciate some input/advice. Travelled from PSP to YYZ with a layover in ORD on May 12th.. where I missed my connection. 

  White departing for Palm Springs – we were oversold by 7(?) Seats & were told we could not board until 7 people volunteered for a later flight. 

 Then after boarding – we were held on the tarmac as the temperature at PSP was ‘hotter than they expected’ in the desert (?) and crew were adjusting weights/balances on the aircraft. 

Then while taxi-ing out to the runway – we were delayed once again, waiting to depart (10-15 min). 

 When arriving in ORD – we landed on the apparent furthest runway (as per the pilots announcement)

 After approximately 15-20 mins, we arrived at our gate only to find out another flight had taken our gate/airbridge, and had to wait again for 20ish minutes to get to our new assigned gate, and then had to wait to deplane at said gate. my flight was scheduled to depart at 2020 – I arrived at my gate for my departure at 20:28 and my flight had already departed.

 Once deplaned and realized my flight had departed, I went to customer service, who then proceeded to tell me they would not give me a voucher for hotel or food as it was not their fault I missed the connection. I had to book a hotel & rebook a flight for 08:30 the next day. 

 ALL that to say… does American owe me for the missed connection/hotels/food? & Why on some flights do they ensure people have arrived from connecting flights & are boarded before take-off, versus this situation?

2023-12-10 23:04:07,Inexperienced flyer with questions,"I need advice! 

Long time lurker- first time poster. Sorry this is a long post, but I am not a frequent flyer. I am hoping you guys can give me some advice for how to make sure I have smooth travel. 

I booked a flight to go overseas. I made one booking through one company, American Airlines. The booking includes three flights each way, and each of those flights is operated by a different airline. First leg is American Airlines; second leg is Iberia, and the final leg is British Airways. The return trip is the same, but in reverse. I booked basic economy, and I got a booking reference from AA. 

I wanted to select my seats for each of the flights, so I input my booking reference in AA app, and was able to select and pay for seats for the two flights operated by AA. No problems. Seat info is showing up in the app, and all is well. 

To select seats for my other flights, I have to book through each partner’s website. I use my AA booking reference, and I am easily able to find my flight on BA’s website. 

BA let me select and pay for seats on BOTH my BA flights and my Iberia flight. Awesome, right? Two birds, one stone. The Iberia flight is the one that actually crosses the pond, so I splurged and got some better seats for that flight. BA charges my credit card for all four seat selections (IB and BA flights going to destination and the return trip). BA emails me a receipt with all the correct seat information for BA and IB flights with a booking reference number. 

Two weeks pass, and BA app does not show seat information for Iberia flight. After a lengthy chat with a BA agent, I get a new booking reference to use on BA’s website for my assigned seats on Iberia. While I’m chatting with the agent, I plug in the booking reference, and it shows the seats I’ve already paid for. Awesome, right? 

Nope. About five minutes after telling the agent how thankful I am, that booking reference no longer shows any seat selection. What’s the deal??

Can someone help me out? I really just want the smoothest travel experience I can get. 

Specific questions:

1. What should I do about the seats I’ve paid for? Do I need to go back to BA and get help?
 
2. When I board each of these flights, do I need to download all three mobile apps and scan the appropriate boarding pass? Or would my AA pass work for all three flights? 

3. Should I get a paper boarding pass? 

4. Do you have any experience with something like this? Anything specific I should prepare for? 

5. Bonus question! This flight has a 90 minute layover in LHR. I shouldn’t have to change terminals, but this is still a tight connection from what I am told. What can I do to prepare for this?

Boise to Seattle is with Alaska Airlines, a partner.  Yet as we discovered, it doesn't operate that way.  We tried buying our additional luggage online via Emirates for the whole itinerary the night before.  Nope.  Emirates says buy it through Alaska since that's flight one.  Ok.  Alaska counter attendant a bit confused.  We made her print us a receipt ($200 per 50lb bag).  

THEN!  Emirates requires a hotel voucher for when she lands in Dubai.  BUT! They don't issue that at the time of ticket purchase.  Additionally they don't issue that via their connecting partner (Alaskan), we had to pick that up at the Gate in Seattle from Emirates.  And of course, they made my mother-in-law provide the receipt for her luggage, or else she would have been paying again.  Which we had the foresight to make the Alaska agent print for us.  

Then she arrives in Dubai, hoping to take the shuttle to her hotel.  Nope.  She needs a Visa for the overnight stay designed into their route.  Someone reading this might blame us, but none of this information is on any ticket, receipt, etc. from Emirates.  Additionally we had to call after buying our ticket to arrange the hotel voucher.  Despite her automatic eligibility, it's NOT automatically issued.  Called before buying the ticket, they said, After you buy the ticket, call back and arrange the voucher.  In neither of those calls did they mention she needed to arrange a Visa in advance for her 14 hour sleep over.  Finally, you can't pick seats until after buying the ticket.  You have to log into your booking, and buy your seat assignments if you want.  All that to say, we received two or three emails in regard to the ticket purchase and the seats at time of purchase.  Unlike every other airline, that's the last you hear from them.  No reminder emails 24 hours in advance, nothing.  Also, Alaska cannot print the boarding pass for the connecting Emirates flight. Again, pick up at the gate from Emirates

In summary, it's a lot of decentralized DIY going through Emirates that is way less conventional than western airlines.

2024-03-21 15:47:58,Seating under airport control- cant choose seats online!," 

Hello,

My husband and I are flying to LHR tomorrow from Denver, CO at 6:30pm on British Airways. We have 2 different reservations, I booked it thru American Airlines and he booked it thru his credit card points (Capital One), we both booked basic economy seats. We were able to pick seats a few weeks ago when I checked for a price, so we decided to wait until check in to get them free of cost.

I checked by reservation yesterday morning (8am) and seats were open for me to choose from at no cost, so I chose an aisle seat, but when I logged in into my husbands booking to pick his seat, all the seating chart was X out (unavailable). We called and British Airways said the seating is now ""under airport control"" and that they had no access to change any seating. They said to go to the airport to have a seat assigned.

How can that be? I am still able on my reservation to switch seats and no cost, but he can't? Is it because we booked it thru different agents (I did it thru American Airlines, a partner airline and he did it thru Capital One)? I also want to add that I have gold status on American Airlines.

Our fear is that the flight is overbooked and he won't be able to make it without a seat until tomorrow when we check in at airport.

I appreciate any advise. Thank you!",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bk9ouy/seating_under_airport_control_cant_choose_seats/,"Seating under airport control- cant choose seats online!

2024-02-02 13:13:11,Unanswered AirAsia Complaint - Non-Reclining Seats & Damaged Tablet (4.5hr Flight)," 

Hi everyone,

I'm hoping to glean some wisdom from the community regarding a recent experience with AirAsia. While I understand it's not the most pressing issue out there, I'm feeling a bit lost and would appreciate some guidance.

On a recent flight that lasted roughly 4.5 hours, both my wife and I encountered considerable discomfort due to our assigned seats being completely unable to recline. This was particularly challenging for me as I have a pre-existing back condition.

Adding to the inconvenience, the in-flight entertainment tablet assigned to me also malfunctioned and was unusable throughout the journey. We informed a flight attendant about these issues during the flight and followed their recommendation by submitting a detailed complaint with supporting documentation afterwards.

Despite submitting a complaint two months ago and receiving an ""escalation"" email (apologizing for the delay) over a month ago, we have yet to receive any additional updates or a resolution from AirAsia.

My questions:

* Considering the prolonged silence and impact on our comfort, especially my back condition, is it reasonable to reach out to AirAsia again?
* Are there any recommended steps I can take to pursue some form of acknowledgement or gesture of goodwill, considering both the non-reclining seats and the damaged tablet?
* Has anyone else faced similar situations with AirAsia? If so, what advice can you offer on how you approached it?

I understand that airlines face various challenges, and I don't intend to cause any unnecessary trouble. However, I humbly believe that some form of acknowledgement or a gesture of goodwill wouldn't be unreasonable, given the circumstances.

Hey reddit, I am a first time international traveller. I'm going from Mumbai to Brussels and returning Amsterdam to Mumbai. I have booked Lufthansa airlines both ways and there is a layover in Munich for both journeys.

I have a few questions-

1. I have not reserved a seat by paying extra and I do not intend to pay that amount. I am traveling solo and fine with any seat. How will I get the automatic seat selection? At the airport while baggage checkin or the webcheck 48 hrs before?

2. Do I have to do a webcheck for my Munich to Brussels flight as well?

3. How do I get my boarding pass for Munich to Brussels?

4. In case of flight delay which results in me missing my next flight, does Lufthansa compensate? 

Thanks in advance for all the answers reddit, be awesome as always!",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1abhyhb/first_time_international_traveller_from_mumbai_to/,"First time international traveller from Mumbai to Brussels First time international traveller

2023-09-10 23:19:43,Cheapest way to fly between LA and NYC every two months,"My partner lives in Ithaca, 4 hrs north of NYC. I visit her every two months but the flights to Ithaca are crazy expensive from Long Beach where I live (I typically fly out from LAX), so I fly to JFK, Laguardia, Newark (which are typically cheaper than Ithaca but still expensive) and take a bus from there which is still a hassle. Otherwise I fly to Syracuse which is an hour away, but it's roughly the same cost as Ithaca. Is there an airline subscription/card/travel hack I can use to do these frequent trips in the long run? Even if It's only to NYC and back, it'll be great to know as looking for cheap flights every time is exhausting and I'm currently managing these trips through points from Chase sapphire.",6,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16ff5f0/cheapest_way_to_fly_between_la_and_nyc_every_two/,"Cheapest way to fly between LA and NYC every two months My partner lives in Ithaca, 4 hrs north of NYC.

2023-12-10 00:03:56,Solo travel w a 4mo old,"We’re going to my parents for the holidays and it’s our 4 months old baby’s first time on a plane. Looking for helpful tips on how we can make this trip smoother. We’re staying at their house and there’s also a 2 hour time difference between states and I’d like to see if there’s anything I can do for her with the jet lag. 

It’s a 3.5 hr flight on Southwest Airlines to LAX. We did not purchase another seat for her so we can’t really bring the car seat on the plane, it will be checked in. I doubt they will have an extra seat since it’s peak season. She breastfeeds and also drinks formula and I’ve read that feeding during takeoff/landing helps soothes them. Any other advice?

I’m so nervous to be by myself with baby - first time flying with her hoping she will be good and work with me, feeling anxious already with the crowd and people that may stare at us if she starts crying and crying and I can’t console her and if i breastfeed her I hope people will just look the other way and not say something mean. I wish I didn’t have to be on my own but plans had to change and husband has to come at a later date instead because of work.

2023-10-09 00:08:56,Seeking recommendations for new under-seat travel duffel,"I am looking for recommendations for a duffel that can serve as a personal item to go under the airplane seat (not the overhead bin.) 

My very old sports duffle that I usually travel with is starting to wear down and I want something new but am having a hard time finding something that’s affordable ($30-90 range), reliable, has a shoulder strap not just  the side loops, and most of all will be small enough to fit under the seat while still being able to fit a decent amount of stuff (toiletries, change of clothes, laptop, food, etc.) 

I know different airlines have different specs but I travel on multiple companies (mostly American Airlines, Delta, Southwest, or JetBlue). My current bag is 19”x7.5”x12.5” and it has fit everywhere I’ve travelled.

2023-07-19 01:21:15,Frontier is a budget airline and is always cheaper? Nope.,"Today I was looking for a round trip from Portland (pdx) to Denver for two people. I did a comparsion shopping between United and Frontier. Both are direct flights. Economy. Carry-On, no checked-in bags. With seat selections. United was cheapter for 2 passengers by about $150!   
I don't get it. Frontier is a budget airline and Denver is their hub airport.  
Also, United had better departure and arrival times. Plus unlike Frontier with their no recline seats, United probably has seats that recline.  


Beware of Frontier's 'Taxes & Carrier imposed Fees' that are added at the very end. Those were quite high unlike United's. Those fees do not include Frontiers'  $29 package (the less expensive package that I selected) to be able to have a carry-on and seat selection.

Don't ever think that a budget airline will always be cheaper. Do your homework and compare prices.
